"October 3, 2020",Entertaining and somewhat difficult but not to much just right. Would definitely say this is a sit down and be ready to spend time (approximately 30 to 45 minutes storyline) with not really a let me spend 5 minutes and be done with it kinda game yes you can always save and pick up where you left off but not as fun loses some of the trill also it has an amazing reply value I have played it about 50 time's (has different paths but basically all the same)and still get a kick out of it.,5,"Giant NetworkOctober 9, 2020Thank you for your review ^_^. Have a wonderful day and best of luck at our game! ^_^"
"October 19, 2020","This is undoubtedly the best game in the app store. Reminiscent of Slay The Spire but different enough to stand right alongside it as the best in the genre. Not quite as challenging as StS, but more accessible with leagues better graphics and overall aesthetic. Do yourself a favor and buy everything available. It's fairly cheap and every piece of DLC adds more layers to it's infinite replayability. Support these guys so we keep getting more!",5,"Giant NetworkOctober 19, 2020Thank you for your lovely comment. This means a lot to us!

"August 8, 2020","Love the game. Only phone game I ever spent money on. However it can be riddled with (easily avoidable) glitches, the main glitch i have found is the game offering me 2 of the same blessing but it doesnt stack. An example being lightning fast reflexes (the one where you dodge and deal 6 damage) only dealing 6 damage if the game offers it to you twice. However other than that i do love the game. (Nearly done with every page in the book. Working on the ranger.)",5,"Giant NetworkAugust 10, 2020Hello. Thank you for supporting us! We appreciate it so much!

"May 15, 2019","I've lost all content that I paid for. Sdk login failure. Please advise. I was completely in love with this game. I reached out over discord, facebook, and email. The only advice I got was to log out and back in. Which isn't possible, as I'm not logged in to begin with. A paid game should get better support. Network problems from 5/11-5/14 didn't cause my issues that started weeks before that, and resolving said network issues has not resolved my sdk login failure.",1,"Giant NetworkMay 15, 2019Hi, Sorry about the it, a lot of had login problem. We suffered some network problem last two days.
Now, we might have worked it out, please try it again."
"October 1, 2020",Have only played for an hour or so but I really like it! One suggestion I have is that on the app if you could explain what the other locked classes do that would be helpful--I'd like to buy one or two but it doesn't say from the app what that class does. For the developer: do you have other games in the works as well? Interested!,5,"Giant NetworkOctober 9, 2020Good day to you! Thank you for your feedback Because our main goal is to provide everyone with the best gaming experience, we are going to keep your input in mind."
"November 20, 2020","Genios work. Very simple but interesting game play, very different tactics available and amazing art. Even story, although short and based on known tale, still interesting to follow. Big thanks to developers, your work inspiring! Also, very good policy about manitisation. Although there are adds, they are not overwhelming and you can avoid them without negative affect on game play. You can support developers buy purchasing new content and it is first mobile game where I did so. I do suggest it!",5,"Giant NetworkNovember 24, 2020Thank you for your review ^_^. Have a wonderful day and best of luck at our game! ^_^"
"May 4, 2020","this game was originally a game you could play offline, but now I need wifi in order to play which is annoying. a lot of times through the week I dont have wifi and this game was my entertainment. if I cant play offline I'm probably just going to end up deleting it because that's the time I played most often.",2,"Giant NetworkMay 4, 2020Hello, dear Madi.

"October 30, 2020","The Nature Spirit boss fight is hella buggy. After lose and in need to watch the ads to ressurect, the game freeze after i finished watching the ads. So l need to force closed the game in the end. Then after i finally managed to almost killed the boss, the game freeze when i try to use a card. And ofc, after force closed, i need to RESTART THE WHOLE BATTLE! It happened twice, I can't win. If these bugs are specific to certain phone spec like my Realme pro 3, then i might consider uninstall.",3,"Giant NetworkOctober 30, 2020We are sorry to hear that you feel this way.

"June 6, 2020",Edit revised. I finally beat Grandma! YES! I've added the other paid features. I'm very impressed and happy with the game. The price is fare. Not tricks. One time + extra if you want. But not overly pay to play! So I really respect that fact. You can play free. ads are worth watching to double the gold award! fun all around. After playing for months it's my #1 all time favorite card games. Voices are hilarious. Diaries add on awesome! Please add more chapters. Game deserves a sequel!

"January 21, 2021","I'm very choice with my reviews. But this game deserves it. I've literally been playing it for years. YEAAAAAARS! Super fun roguelike with a lot of replayability that you can learn for a challenge or even play casually. I will say there is paid dlc, but im pretty sure you pay like 10 dollars total for all classes and the expanses and for the content, I'd compare it to slay the spire. I'd say even better. In my mind amongst my favourite rogue lites.",5,"Giant NetworkJanuary 22, 2021Welcome to join our community activities and have the opportunity to unlock new content for free.

"September 10, 2020","Wish there was at least 2 other classes & paths we can play, really disappointing short game for free player. Like other card games every class is unlock except for 1, why couldn't this card game be like that? Sigh this game is taken over by greed & it shows. You'd probably have over 5m downloaded if this game more had classes & paths. For real just think of how fun free players have, I know there's more free players than buyers! We probably make you more $ than paid players via ad. Damn it",2,"Giant NetworkSeptember 11, 2020Thank you for supporting us! We appreciate it so much!

"November 25, 2020","Good game. Still has glitches after beta. You cannot have more than a specific number of cards in your hand at the end of your turn. The game forces you to discard all remaining cards until you reach the maximum allowed at the end of the turn. There are deck and card options that will cause duplicate or extra cards to generate on an attack or action. This causes a bug during the discard period. The game will only allow you to select two cards to discard, preventing end of turn.",4,"Giant NetworkNovember 27, 2020We're so happy to hear that you have fun playing our game.

"September 15, 2020","I had good fun with this. There seems to be a lot of gameplay, and it's a fun card battler, where you get chances to add stronger attacks to your deck and weed out bad ones over time. My only complaint is that I think the rating could use a ""Suggestive Themes"" tag, as there were a number of feminine enemies with low-cut outfits, from what I recall.",4,"Giant NetworkSeptember 18, 2020Thanks for the feedback, there are rich game content, such as collection, exploration, various activities.

"February 2, 2021",Look I start playing this game and I said .. hmm it is ok then I realised that I keep playing the game again and again ... So my resume: the game is amazing. Absolutely stunning in every way but.. the game ends too soon.. I mean you build a deck you play until volume 3 you fight two bosses and then it is over.... And start again.. I want more MORE fun more volumes.. when I build a deck I don't want it to end so soon. Fix it I give you 5 star if u do this too. Great job on the game until now.,4,"Giant NetworkFebruary 9, 2021We're so happy to hear that you have fun playing our game. Please be sure to rate us more stars if you like it.

"May 28, 2020","A seriously good game. One of the few I have paid money for, having bought the collectors edition. Hell, If the devs ever considered producing it, I would even buy a physical copy of this card game I'm enjoying it that much! Edit- after following the advice in your reply to delete the obb file seems to have squashed the freeze/crash bug I had after the last update so back to 5*",5,"Giant NetworkMay 25, 2020Sorry for the problem.

"May 4, 2020",Horrible in game ads in a paid game really ruin the awesome experience this game offer. Dev please remove any ads from paid user. Thanks for the response: will update the rate when such feature to remove ads are implemented. Thanks. Thanks for the update to remove ads. It's 100% much better experience now.

"February 26, 2021",I liked the game a lot but it forgot my purchase of the diaries mode often. I was correcting this everytime i started the game by going to repurchase it again and the game would recognize I had already bought it. Now it is just asking me to buy it again despite being in the middle of a run. It was fun while it worked but I'm not going to buy the mode I enjoy better twice.,1,"Giant NetworkMarch 2, 2021Please send your UID and GPA to our email: nofmgame@hotmail.com.

"April 29, 2020","It was really fun. Buuuuut. It takes a very long time to download. It also takes some starting and restarting to actually get the game to work , and there is only one free character. The rest you have to pay for. And quite it was fun, the one character (the knight) doesn't provide any real versatile game play. Its a shame, really",2,"Giant NetworkApril 30, 2020Greetings! Thank you for supporting us!

"February 7, 2021",I almost gave it five stars but the combat balance is garbage. I can't even get through the first chapter without needing to fight some dude that finds a way to insta kill me after a few rounds. Only way I've gotten past him is by restarting the game and hoping I get lucky this time. Other then that I genuinely enjoy it,4,"Giant NetworkFebruary 9, 2021Welcome to join our community activities and have the opportunity to unlock new content for free.

"July 29, 2020","What I really like about this game is the visuals and challenges it gives. Some parts of the game is rng and requires some strategy which I really enjoy. It's a good card game, but it kinda bothers me that you get only the knight class for free while the rest cost a dollar to unlock. I would understand if the new classes added cost a dollar, but I think a free tryout for each class would be nice to see if someone wants to buy the class.",4,"Giant NetworkJuly 30, 2020Hello.

"December 1, 2020","Insane amounts of replayability and 100% worth the money for all the expansions and the ad removal (dont worry, the ads arent super intrusive or overly annoying). Overall the best card game experience I have found on any platform. Edit: Finally reached 100% completion in every area of this game and it has been one of the best gaming experiences I have had in my 25 years of playing video games.

"April 22, 2020","Good basis for a fun game but most of the actions have to be bought. You only get the one pack and then the rest of the game has to be completely bought. The boss level is hard to do with the cards they give, one small decision on what you want to upgrade can change the entire game. It ridiculous that even after farming and killing each monster in every level you still cannot buy cards or anything to upgrade the cards. The expansion packs of course are only for purchase. I am dissatisfied.",2,"Giant NetworkApril 22, 2020Hello, We are sorry that you do not like the game but we thank you for your feedback. Our future updates will improve the game for you."
"October 8, 2020","Music is beautiful. Art style is very fitting too. Voice Acting is the best. Everything in this game is so done in High Quality. I didn't expect to have such an amazing experience. It's very atmospheric, there were no annoying ads, and the puzzle minigame was such a treat. I keep on installing it again whenever I miss it. This is an offline campaign driven card game but it feels like the popcap and gamehouse games in the XP days. Casual and fun",5,"Giant NetworkOctober 9, 2020Hello! Thank you for your review ^_^. Have a wonderful day and best of luck at our game! ^_^"
"July 14, 2020","The devs put a lot of love in this game, including stereo soundtrack and voice acting. They do a great job of scaling difficulty and with letting the player find ways to work builds to their advantage. Overall, it's great, well made game. Downsides are some translation issues with interpreting card effects, and (at least, for me) the ""church is evil"" story theme. The different classes are fun, as is the art style.",5,"Giant NetworkJuly 15, 2020Hello. Thank you for supporting us! We appreciate it so much!

"October 30, 2020","I've enjoyed the story and game play. Paying twice to get rid of ads was a bit silly so only four stars. Adding to the above, this game has a lot of card descriptions that do not hold up. Example Multiplying Bullet states: Deal damage X. Draw 1 card. What it actually does is not just draw a card, but also play it. This is crucial information if you are trying to do combo decks.",4,"Giant NetworkJuly 13, 2020Thank you for supporting us!

"November 20, 2020",One of my favorite rouge like deck builders. Very well made had a few bugs along the way but they fixed them quickly. Honestly can't wait for them to make more games of this quality. Would like to see 1 final class that's a mix of all classes that's customizable. Were players can choose a mix of blessings that show up and a mix of cards that appear throughout the adventure. Just have it were you can toggle on and off for X amount of cards and X amount of blessings of each rarity.,5,"Giant NetworkNovember 24, 2020We're so happy to hear that you have fun playing our game.

"June 21, 2020",I love this game and honestly I wouldn't review games normally but I dont know how to report a bug. The nun is experiencing a bug where cards like possession won't draw a card when there supposed to. This is on hard 2 so maybe this is only for that difficultly but it makes it near unplayable.

"August 24, 2020","The game looks very good, but.... I just don't get the gameplay. You get 2 cards (or more with upgrades) per turn... and you play those 2 cards (or how many you have). There is zero decision making. Sure, you choose the cards and upgrades between fights, but why do I even have to play the fights when there is no decision involved? Just automatically play the damn cards! There are better versions of this genre, this one is very boring.",2,"Giant NetworkAugust 24, 2020We will optimize the game！"
"June 26, 2020","Fun, simple deckbuilder that's still in early stages of development. Gameplay is solid. Will rate 5 stars when the game is more polished. It currently still needs spelling corrections (word ""tune"" needs to be ""turn"" in UI tooltips for example), & needs a good native English speaker to fix subject-verb agreement in a few descriptions.",4,"Giant NetworkJune 27, 2020We'll optimize the spelling！"
"August 15, 2020",This game is wonderful card game roguelike. I found this game around 3-4 month. Download content of this game can change the style playing card. Before you playing you have to choose your jobs. And go to defeat monster and events in the game trail. Design game play is very amezing. If you want to dond something new from other card game roguelike this game is recommended from me. Ps. When is the next DLC of this game is arrive?

"February 28, 2021","Great casual game, wonderful art and production values. Each class feels unique and plays differently. There isn't much variety within the class though, so each time you play a knight it will play mostly the same.

"November 13, 2020","The art style in this game is amazing, the gameplay feels satisfying even if repetitive at times and the story is simple but its not bad. 3 stars because most of the game is behind a paywall, even if its not much it stops me and im guessing other people from playing once we've done all the ftp stuff.

"September 30, 2020","This game has quickly become my favorite. Awesome writing and art style!

"June 7, 2020","This is a ""slay the spire"" kind of single player adventure card game with multiple classes and several different play styles. Every enemy is voice acted and every card has very nice art. The only gripe I have with this game is that it isn't totally balanced. The soul eater and the knight class for example only really has one viable build. Soul eater can only really do an absorb build and knight can only really do an artillery equipment build (for the higher difficulties)",4,"Giant NetworkJune 7, 2020Hello. Thank you for supporting us!

"October 19, 2020","This is a very enjoyable deck builder, one of the best on mobile. The classes have distinct styles from each other, and within. I have purchased all the DLC and the found the prices reasonable. One of my best mobile purchases. My only 2 complaints are that there is not a higher difficulty, as I have played this game so much that the top difficulty rarely poses a challenge, and that the difference between the strongest and worst classes is huge.

For 5 USD this could be a goat android game but instead choose to be deceitful and predatorial in its practices. I recommend you play it once, beat it and then uninstall because the other classes arent worth the ""value"" they sell it at.",2,"Giant NetworkJune 15, 2020Greetings Hero!

"July 10, 2020","So the game is great. The story is interesting but not that big, which honestly is preferable. There is no unnecessary padding. Everything about the base gameplay is great. However for the Diaries 'mode' I've encountered a slight issue, mainly with the mage. The only way to beat the Hard mode that I've found is using a very specific (and rare) blessing which relies on my deck being able to apply the chilling effect. Adding more varied powerful cards to the harder difficulties could solve this.",4,"Giant NetworkJuly 10, 2020Hello. Thank you for supporting us! We appreciate it so much!

"June 22, 2020","Great art, sounds, and music. The game let's you play though the first character role and then you have to pay, but the price isn't too bad to unlock most of the game. However, you'll still have ads and you'll still have a couple things locked behind paywalls, such as one other role and what amounts to DLC. There are some translation issues in the game, but nothing that breaks the dialogue as you can still get what they're trying to say without much effort.",4,"Giant NetworkJune 23, 2020Hello.

"February 4, 2021","Solid gameplay, great art style, and pretty balanced difficulty curve.

I wish that all of the harder base levels of the game at least could be for free (Ranger, Nun Witch), only when you complete the previous Hardest variation of the last Difficulty I currently have 29 wins on the Knight (Hard VII) Difficulty, And there's only so much you can do the same of, since I've beat all of the achievements that you can do on knight Difficulty, so I'll do 4 stars.",4,"Giant NetworkMay 12, 2020Hello, Domin Cuba.

"November 3, 2020","Fun game with a nice art style and engaging gameplay that's easy at first but gets much harder. If you want to beat the really tough enemies in hard mode, you're going to need luck to have good cards in your deck and the right cards in your hand on the first turn, resulting in more than a few resets. But at the end of the day, it feels satisfying playing your entire deck and doing 400 damage in 1 turn when you feel like that shouldn't be a thing.",5,"Giant NetworkNovember 3, 2020We're so happy to hear that you have fun playing our game.

I love the style, the mechanics in this game, and lot's of strategys that I can play with. but of course there are some nickpicking I have to say and hoping for future updates. 1. I don't like the fact that Forest Spirit have a ability to turn half of my cards into claws and revive himself I would be fine if he just only revive himself but I can't beat him! 2. Would be nice if there is at least 3-5 save slots each time I want to play a different class.

I even went on and bought the rest of the content.

"June 5, 2020","Used to be good, one of my favorite games on mobile. I liked that you could pay, and opt out of ads. But the new expansion is not up to the same quality standards, and they've begin adding more ads throughout, even though I have paid for the game. I uninstalled it despite having paid for all the content and won't be playing anymore. It's a reasonable game. Would have given it 4 or 5 stars a few years ago, but the new direction is unfortunate.",3,"Giant NetworkJune 7, 2020The ads is not compulsory. It will be appeared when you open the treasure.

"October 19, 2020",You can only play as the knight unless you pay. The other classes can't be unlocked otherwise. Plus the werewolf boss fight is near impossible unless your are dealing 30 damage consistently every turn for twenty turns straight. I got a good defender build and the wolf couldn't break through my armor. But I couldn't deal enough damage to compensate for his 20 health heal he does every turn. Than my deck got muddled with prank cards and it was done after that.,1,"Giant NetworkOctober 23, 2020I’m sorry to hear that.

The gameplay is smooth and fun but with that said, It COULD be a #1 if i wasnt for the (🐖🤑 Devs) You lost one ☆ because all the content should be able to be unlocked normally as other big games did.

"June 24, 2020","Great game. If you like to challenge yourself, then there is about 8-15 hours worth of free play. You get the Knight and Magician. Both are fun. The variety of playing styles inside of each class is more robust than I would have expected. Very well done. I love the way they place the ads. They are completely optional and where they are placed well worth the extra 30 secs. 5 star if there was more free content",4,"Giant NetworkJune 27, 2020Hello. Thank you for supporting us!

"February 2, 2021",A pretty solid deck building game. And the voice acting and artstyle is just amazing. Though in terms of gameplay it may be pretty difficult for newcomers. Especially when facing the Cursed Wolf (that was just brutal) the difficulty just jumps a notch. Still it was fun and exhilarating. It was a fairly difficult challenge.

"October 31, 2020","Incredible game, pay once and you've got hours of content. Get all of the expansions trust me they are worth it. It's not pay to win AT ALL which is why I recommend it HIGHLY. Another thing I like is there are times when you can watch one ad to do things like double your money at the end of the boss fight or reviving. Awesome graphics, super fun.

It might seem like it at first because you need to pay to unlock other characters, but there is so much gameplay on just the first character that it has kept me interested for months.

"June 8, 2020","It is addicting and great for short breaks or during the commute. The initial, free download is more of a preview/demo, making only the Knight class available. For the other classes and game modes, you'll have to purchase them as DLCs. It is worth it though, aside from supporting the devs, the gameplay is varied enough on different classes and even when repeating the same class. There are some negative reviews against ads, but they're not really required to be clicked and can be ignored.",5,"Giant NetworkJune 9, 2020Hello. Thank you for supporting us!

"June 30, 2020","Best roguelike card game in the market by far. Diverse card selection and synergies makes the game incredibly fun and replayable. Only downside compared to other AAA roguelike is the replayability after completing the game / achievements. Other roguelikes would have dailies and leaderboard to encourage further playing. After that point, there's really no incentive to continue playing. As such I'd be very excited if another expansion were to be released.",5,"Giant NetworkJuly 1, 2020Hello.

"July 12, 2020","Great game I've been playing the game for about a month now so far a good game to pass the time at home during quarantine It has a good storyline, sometimes l get immerse in the universes story A good base gameplay, its hard to find that good game where every new gameplay you start is different yet drives you to play again I have bought the DLC.... l was wondering if you guys are working on a different game with story about Riding Hoods mother or an actual RPG for the game.

"October 6, 2018","I was really enjoying this game. I had a fun deck built, had defeated multiple bosses and was considering purchasing the new chapters. Then boom, my save is gone one day. I hand not played in a few days, no update was applied. I went to continue my story and no save data was found. I tried to pull the backup and nothing there either. I'm pretty annoyed since deck I built was personal to me. Won't be coming back now.",2,"Giant NetworkOctober 9, 2018Did you clean the memory of you phone? Cause it may clean the data of our game."
"August 3, 2020","I'm f2p player and this game kept me awake for about 20 hours(thanks to covid quarantine), finishing it up to the highest difficulty available for f2p. I'd be lying if I say I don't enjoy it, the story plot got me hooked(even though it was cheesy, though it's understandable), the gameplay has various playstyles to experiment with, which I adore(though some card combinations just breaks the game with spam units).

Only 4 stars because the game is advertised as an OFFLINE game yet I can't play the soul hunter unless I log-in and stay on the net. Also, when I play with net, the Ads don't work.

"December 23, 2020","I'm not really into card games but this is an exception. Both graphics and gameplay are superb. It's simple and easy to play. Controls aren't confusing and the narration is great. The game gives off the ""Franbow"" vibe because the artstyle is so close to it. A mixture of cartoon-ish and spooky. Very great game. Though I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because you need to unlock the dlc through real life payment. Kinda sad but you get a free class (magician) which is very overpowered.

"September 17, 2020",I generally have enjoyed the game within the first few minutes. No lengthy tutorial. It just throws you into the mix and forces you to figure it out. The Werewolf path was frustrating but is my favorite out of all. The Rage ability really allows you to dole out some vengeance prior to and after your enemies' turn and I love the way the numbers from each attack and action card just meld together,5,"Giant NetworkSeptember 18, 2020We're so happy to hear that you have fun playing our game.

"February 14, 2021","A thoroughly pleasant game if you like the roguelike card genre.

"July 25, 2020","I really enjoy this game and I've bought all if the classes and the DLC. However, this game tends to freeze for me quite a bit. Normally it would only freeze once or twice during a session, however, I'm at the final boss in part if the DLC and it keeps freezing right as I'm about to kill him. I've restarted the app 7 times at the time of writing this (only including the times its crashed during this fight).

"May 2, 2020","Fun but how to replenish health?? After you battle the enemy and you end up with low health, how do I replenish my health again if I dont level?

"February 9, 2021","Simply put, this game is fun, but it lacks the replay value the description leads you to think it'd have. You only get one class to start with, and while the rest are cheap, it's even cheaper that you get locked out of 7/8ths of the game if you don't pay up, even more so if you go past just the classes. Knight is fun, but exclusively knight isn't. Giving everyone just one extra class to start would make this game so much better. But unless they do something like that, I won't be playing much.",3,"Giant NetworkFebruary 9, 2021Welcome to join our community activities and have the opportunity to unlock new content for free.

For example: When you fight and die, sometimes you get the chance to revive (and get a perk) after watching an ad. Not so with ad free version... Not cool... Also, I should get credit for buying some of the items from a bundle when purchasing that bundle... Also not cool...

"November 30, 2020","Very fun. Could be better. The amount of cards make trying new strategies fun, and keeps the restarting fresh. However, the Hard mode doesn't have a lot of features of its own, this isn't good when Normal has eputation and courage, and dialogue and decision making. I think more talents would be cool too, yes we unlock new cards for achievements and everything but I feel adding more talents and perhaps have only final bosses give them, or something.

"November 6, 2018","Edit: After following the kind advice from the developer to conserve heals and making a more balanced deck, I finally beat the boss in the lady knight class. Definitely enjoyed the gameplay more this time around & will be thinking about buying the other classes. Previous review: I was having fun until I had to keep fighting enemies with low health near the end of chapter three while playing the free lady knight class. I started a new adventure several times trying to get past this point, but found it impossible without more opportunities to heal between harder battles. On my last attempt before I deleted the app, I beat the demon king at the cost of a lot of HP, & couldn't defeat the other enemies I was expected to fight afterwards. It's a shame, b/c I would've loved to buy the other classes if the game hadn't become so frustrating. The graphics, voice acting, & different cards are really great. I just want more full heals between battles.",5,"Giant NetworkNovember 5, 2018Hi did you pass the final boss?
I can give you some tips about saving HP and you can try it again
1. Save fountain until your HP is at a very low value or before boss
2. Save bandage if you are about to level up (it will recover all HP)

While if you passed the game, please come back and leave a 5-star to us.
More tips you can find on our Facebook."

"June 11, 2020","I had so much fun playing it! The artwork is stunning! The character voices fit fabulously! I love the characters lines! It makes everyone seem so human! Every enemy has their own style of attack, and it spices up the game so much! The only complaint I could have is that the end scenes translations are a little strange but it dosen't really take away from the story. Also you have to pay for the other classes, but honestly? It's deserving. I wish I could friend the carpenter boy, he precious T-T",5,"Giant NetworkJune 11, 2020Hello. Thank you for supporting us! We appreciate it so much!

"January 8, 2021",Players: Highly recommend this game. Best go to game with tons of game time and low cost permanent add ons that make it even better. A Must play. Developers: I am a Long time player and I absolutely love this game. I have completed almost every achievement and all pages of both books. I have 2 request 1:can u add another add on to complete the diarys book with the rest of the characters. 2:can u expand on the pocket watch some more maybe a second tier for diarys,5,"Giant NetworkJanuary 8, 2021Please send your thoughts to our email address: nofmgame@hotmail.com We will continue to work hard！"
"November 5, 2018","The game is very simple yet entertaining, art style quite suits the game, and prob even weaker phones are capable of running it. Cards are interesting, and player is able to combo cards in order to maximise their effectiveness (in some cases damage output is a bit too high in my opinion). However my rating is severely lowered because of the limit of the content because of purchasable characters. Far as I know, it used to be way more fun and way more entertaining because of more playable (free) classes. What I'd suggest is to leave (as it is) one class available and allow player to unlock two other through achievements or simply completing the game, and leave rest purchasable.",2,"Giant NetworkNovember 6, 2018thx for the detailed comment. actually we indeed had the free version (Beta version)before. but due to policy change of Google play. we had to make some changes. besides, we also have to spend fees on the further development and need some necessary funds."
"November 3, 2020","Starts out fun, but at the higher levels its all luck. If you dont get the right cards, its impossible to win. So you basically just keep scrolling dice and hope to get lucky. If youre unlucky, erase all of your progress and try again. With no capacity to build an actual custom deck, its basically flipping coins and hoping to get lucky with each fight. Mathmatically it can be impossible to win. Meh.",2,"Giant NetworkNovember 3, 2020Good day to you! We are sorry to hear that you feel that way.

"November 15, 2018","Really enjoy the game. But it's a little imbalanced. I'm having some incredible difficulty with nun, but completed it with magician and little witch, both the same difficulty. Game difficulty builds rapidly, to the point where you wonder why normal difficulty is so damn hard. Some cards in the shop have way too high price tags and are impossible to get. Every class has a weakness in one or two specific enemies. You will probably lose if you don't chance upon any recovery after one of those fights or level up from it.",3,"Giant NetworkNovember 14, 2018hi please follow our FB page: https://www.facebook.com/NightofFullMoonCardGame and DM us directly."
"November 14, 2020","I rarely regret a purchase but this game ended up being one of them. The game seems to be fun and full of content that has a little bit locked behind a paywall... Which is kinda true. The f2p portion of the game is easily the best and only worthwhile aspect of the game. If you pay to unlock all of the content you will soon find that the game is very, VERY, chinese. I'm talking broken unintelligible gibberish, cards that don't do what they say, etc. Worth it to play, not worth spending on though.",2,"Giant NetworkNovember 18, 2020Thank you for supporting us!

"August 23, 2020","It's rigged. I have played for days on both the knight and the magician and I am unable to get past the 3rd hard stage on either one.

If you can't beat the bosses at the 3rd hardest, how can you after that point?",1,"Giant NetworkAugust 24, 2020The boss is not invincible.

"January 1, 2021","It has potential, BUT there are serious balance issues for certain classes against things like the phantom captain vs a soul hunter class. The effects of the two damage abilities redirected is way too strong for that class in specific. For example I would have to do 24 damage to myself in order to do 6 damage to the enemy. That is a huge issue that needs looking into. If they balance out the classes better the rating will change.

"June 14, 2020",This has been one of the best games I've ever payed for.. it was great having to earn better cards and plan and strategise to beat the end boss.. I would pay for any expansion packs or spin offs hoping them to be even close to as good as the game itself. because the few quid I have payed has given me longer play time than any new game that comes out for a games console.. the story is cool with the whole fairytale spin. Can't say enough.. great game..people are nitpicky..anything similar up soon?,5,"Giant NetworkJune 15, 2020Hello. Thank you for supporting us! We appreciate it so much!

"November 12, 2020","I love the roguelike elements, it makes every run of the game feel extremely unique. Even on repeat runs the game is enjoyable.

It's also relatively cheap. The visual effects are well animated, the voicelines are great and the art style is also very cool.

"August 16, 2020",Awesome game. Well enough that I decided to purchase all classes and the ad-free upgrade. Didn't regret it. Gameplay is short enough that you don't feel like grinding but not too short that it leaves you wanting. Someone mentioned in their review that buying the ad-free upgrade made them lose the opportunity to get a bonus on reviving. Not true in my case. I can get the bonus minus the ads.

"August 26, 2020","🏆AMAZING card game with a bit of a twist. LOVE! 💖 I am pretty picky when it comes to games. I like my old school game consoles (Nintendo's, Sega, etc) and only a couple ""newer"" games (W.O.W., Skyrim, The Sims). HOWEVER, THIS GAME WON ME OVER IMMEDIATELY!

Not that bad, so why 1 star? The rest of the characters are locked behind a paywall. Is it unlocked after you complete the previous character? No. It should unlock the next stage instead of hard locking it behind a paywall.

"November 12, 2020","The fact that there's no forced ads is brilliant, that right there bumps it up a star to 2 Stars, second, it's a pretty fun game and items in-game are really cheap. That makes it 3 stars. It has interesting mechanics that are inspired by slay the spire, but it's not so ridiculously hard that I can't enjoy it. That makes it 4 stars.

Waiting on food at a restaurant? I play this game. Sitting in an online Zoom class while the teacher has a one-on-one with another student? I play this game. I don't have enough room in this text box, but the game is very open, and they're always new ways to play and new cards to add.

"February 24, 2021","This game is worth the spend. What's available f2p is limited but enough to decide to pay for some content. Graphics are great, the gameplay is well done, and the mini games and content is fun. Is it hard in some places, yes. But you can figure it out and enough guides online to help you along. Is there a huge replay value? Not really. But I like a good end game. I like to casually revisit maybe once a month or so but that doesn't diminish the value.",5,"Giant NetworkFebruary 26, 2021Welcome to join our community activities and have the opportunity to unlock new content for free.

"June 13, 2020","Really interesting card based game! I love the RPG element to it, and how each choice has different outcomes, some very unexpected ha ha! The demo free version is more than enough to fulfill you. I think I may go ahead and purchase more. I just dont like that you cant read the cards or effects since it moves by really fast, but thats not a major setback! Love the visuals too. Great stuff",5,"Giant NetworkJune 15, 2020Hello.

"November 5, 2020","Great game all round, I 100% it before the mechanic came out. Has an issue when I'm offline saying all characters are locked when Ive purchased them, but other then that no issues other then some translation errors.

"December 21, 2020","Great game! Very in-depth, with lovely art and a great story! The only issue I've had is for some reason, the game suddenly stopped me from collecting ad rewards. Not a huge issue, but still a bit frustrating, especially since I paid to have the ads removed to allow me to collect rewards faster. That doesn't detract from my rating. If you enjoy strategy and deckbuilder games, this one is a must play.",5,"Giant NetworkDecember 22, 2020Thank you for your review ^_^. Have a wonderful day and best of luck at our game! ^_^"

"December 15, 2020","The game is funf. The gameplay is the usual rogue-like deckbuilding, but you keep everything simple to understand, making a combo easy. Graphic is cute, yet dark, givin' that nice gothic vibe. The ingame purchase is worth the price, its opens a whole new world to the game.

"January 3, 2021","Almost the entire game is locked behind a pay wall, but they've been adding plenty of content even for f2p players. It's a very easy game compared to its obvious 'inspiration', Slay the Spire, but it does have harder difficulties later on and challenges to face. It's not amazingly well balanced but it's better than almost every other mobile game out there. I wasn't going to change my prior middling review, but one day I noticed that a second class had been unlocked via play!

"August 23, 2020","It is a very nice card game, though it is sometimes impossible to beat the last boss in hard vii even with good preparation as randomness on buffs and cards is too high, so one has to start the whole episode again.

"August 20, 2020",Fun challenging and enjoyable the first app i chose to upgrade easily as it gives me much more to practice with and learn to play as through each class comes a entirely different way to play and new cards it reminded me of rpgs i grew up with but mixed with the randomness of games like candies and curses it pretty much begs you to play more whether free or not even the one first class gives plenty to experience hope this helps and have fun,5,"Giant NetworkAugust 21, 2020Thanks for the feedback, there are rich game content, such as collection, exploration, various activities.

It would be much more fun if there was a way that you could improve your deck as you win, but after the initial coin improvements then you are waiting for the cosmic lottery to give you the needed cards to win a given difficulty. I would really like to keep 1 card after a hard-mode win, or even a permanent enhance to a card or else it's a loser loop.",2,"Giant NetworkJanuary 13, 2021Thank you for supporting us!

"November 5, 2020","I really enjoy this game with its variety of cards and game play with lots of replay-ability. HOWEVER some English texts are confusing and I really wish there was an infinite mode to challenge you to reach as far as you can as I find my self completely obliterating some runs and I would highly enjoy seeing how far I could get in an endless run situation. My last criticism would be the lack of upgradable bonuses for all runs. In short, after story line stuff needs a long stretch style difficulty",5,"Giant NetworkNovember 6, 2020Good day to you!

"October 6, 2018","A very fun card building, turn based battle game. While the execution of the gameplay is wonderful and the art and audio is amazing, the game seems to suffer from some balancing issues. It doesn't seem very fair if an enemy can kill me in one or two turns consistently when I'm at full health. The dialogue options also seem to appear randomly which can cause it to be difficult to gain the amount of courage or reputation you need. May be a very worthwhile game if some of the enemies can be balanced out.",3,"Giant NetworkOctober 9, 2018Thanks for your suggestion. We have balanced a lot in our new version.

I wish there were more like it. While there are other roguelike card games, this one is a bit more arcade like, in that it builds up quickly, each class is widely different, and you are not limited to very low energy amounts. Each playthrough is a chance to dominate or be dominated! I can't wait for the next update!",5,"Giant NetworkJanuary 29, 2021Good day to you!

"September 16, 2020","Very addictive rogue like card game if you are a fan of yugioh or any card games and rogue genre you will have fun. The story and setting is very interesting, dark, mysterious and engaging. Only complaint is you cant unlock other clases unless you pay which isnt really bad since its one dollar. Only wish you could have the opportunity to unlock one class to see how much each class brings or a one time trial. Definitely give this game a try.",5,"Giant NetworkSeptember 18, 2020Thank you for your lovely comment. This means a lot to us!

"June 12, 2020",Very nice take on a classic story with elegant mechanics on the card game. played on normal which was forgiving and actually enjoyed it very much. I only did my first run (unlocked the witch part of the story) but I already see the replayability value of this game and I love the 'classes' variation of RRH. Definitely would suggest it.,5,"Giant NetworkJune 15, 2020Hello. Thank you for supporting us! We appreciate it so much!

"May 1, 2020","Edit 2nd May 2020: there seems to have been an update to the app where on launch it now says my resource file isnt complete and needs to be downloaded. However it will not download the file so the app is now unusable. It's a shame because if it didnt have this major problem it would be 5 stars. Original review: Great game, cute graphics, with great reply value even without unlocking any DLC. Small note is that ""different"" is spelt incorrectly on the Entangled description :)",1,"Giant NetworkMay 1, 2020Sorry for the problem. You can go to File Management-Mobile Storage-Android-obb-com.ztgame.yyzy to see if there is an .obb file. Delete this file and re-enter the game to see if you can open the game normally. If not,please re-download the game."
"June 19, 2020","Phenomenal game with lots of different and inventive play styles. Ads don't get in the way of gameplay and you can play offline with 0 trouble. If you like the main gameplay offered with the fighter class it's well worth the 7$ to unlock all characters as it greatly expands the replayability, there are a few spelling errors on some of the card descriptions and I wish I could play more then 3 chapters but this game has given me countless hours of fun and I hope they keep adding new content!",4,"Giant NetworkJune 19, 2020Hello.

"February 17, 2021","This game is really fun. Like REALLY fun. Addicting too. Simply put, the only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is there is a small pay wall to access the other classes, and the replayability of the standard game mode is lacking in my opinion. That being said, for < $10 of what I spent totally on this game, I've certainly gotten plenty of time out of it.",4,"Giant NetworkFebruary 19, 2021Thank you for your lovely comment.

"May 31, 2020","I have to say it is an addicting game however i feel you should be able to unlock atleast 2 of the characters for free since like 80% of the game is behind a paywall. It's a great game but it's perpetuality of using the same character just doesn't appeal too much. And i feel like bots are the one that are reviewing these reviews since none of them say ""sorry"" or ""we will fix that""",3,"Giant NetworkMay 31, 2020Hello. Thank you for supporting us!

"January 21, 2020","While I purchased the collector's edition pack, I can't recommend anyone spend money on this game at the moment. There are a lot of bugs. Regular app freezes, cards mechanics that don't work (several list ""Draw 1 card"" but do nothing), and the latest seasonal patch's bosses don't double the gold coins after watching an ad like it says (doing so clears your reward). Just a lot of examples where play testing wasn't thorough. Shame these things make an otherwise great looking game hard to enjoy.",2,"Giant NetworkJanuary 22, 2020Could you kindly tell us more about the problem you are facing at ? We are looking to improve the game. Thanks."
"September 16, 2020","Great game, super entertaining and can be a bit challenging (mainly just the last level of difficulty). But it says offline but it never started for me without internet connection and there is a bug with the fairy blessings: after you pic one sometimes it will appear in the choices again but if you click on it you just waisted a buff (the effect doesn't stack).

"December 13, 2020","Probably the best deckbuilding game ive played in awhile. Many classes with their own unique play styles, with different archetypes in each to try out, a good learning curve with many difficulties, and lots of rewards to be earned from your runs. My fiance showed me this game and i was instantly hooked. Its very obvious that the dev team was passionate about making this game good.",5,"Giant NetworkDecember 17, 2020Hello！We're so happy to hear that you have fun playing our game.

"December 8, 2020","Surprised a game of this caliber is for free. Haven't spend yet on the dlcs but it's clean user interface, wide combo possibilities, and immersive graphic, animation, and audio implementation are amazing. Has immense replay-ability and is breath of fresh air to play through. Would 100% recommend trying at least one run of the game if you enjoy Dungeon runs, adventure deck building (Like Slay The Spire). Looking forward to future updates. Best wishes towards future players and the dev team.",5,"Giant NetworkDecember 9, 2020We apologize for any inconvenience caused to you.

"June 8, 2020","This game is extremely immersive and quite impressive. Every class has any different options as to how you build your deck. With the main being attack focused, defense focused or equipment focused. Attack can have to do with normal attack cards, action cards or magic cards. Some playstyles include special tactics like the proper implementation of trap cards or negative effects on the enemy AI. Timer cards and even self inflicting cards. And all enemies feel different based on your class and deck",5,"Giant NetworkJune 9, 2020Hello. Thank you for supporting us! We appreciate it so much!

"June 20, 2020","Lowered to 3 Starz. I love this game and have purchased additions but I can't progress on the bosses. I beat the witch and get sent back to the front screen. Ok, so I play again. And beat the witch again. Always the witch. None of the others. I've tried every option available, but can't progress. It ends up being the same thing over and over. Got tired and uninstalled. Oh well. Update: I've updated and am trying again. I'll report back 😉",3,"Giant NetworkJune 19, 2020Please upgrade the game to the latest version！"
"May 12, 2020","I paid full price for this game, and now with the update they have added ads. I get that they are optional, but it takes away from the experience, and someone who has already paid 6 usd for a game should not still have to see ads. To comment on the response, even though its optional, its still leaning towards pay (or ads) to win. This disrupts the game balance and just lessens the experience if during a single run you're prompted to watch ads several times.",1,"Giant NetworkMay 12, 2020Hello！Thank you so much for your suggestion.

"December 2, 2020","I thought there was an issue with not being able to save progress but I'm the idiot. The Continue button is close to the Achievement button which makes it look like the same button. Developer answered my message and walked me through. Great game, you feel a little OP and it needs a little polish to make the game feel more put together but it's over fun. Great animation also.

"June 30, 2020","The game is amazing! Gameplay is simple but intuitive, story is worthwhile and enjoyable. Even the characters are super quirky and fun. The only problem is the paywall. Sure you can go for a countless number of playthroughs as one or two characters but that's about it. Not for f2p players, but for those who are willing to pay for extra content, I'd very much recommend it! The game is still an amazing card game, but again, not everyone will want to pay a couple bucks.",5,"Giant NetworkJuly 1, 2020Hello. Thank you for supporting us! We appreciate it so much!

"January 7, 2021","It looks like it should be a fun game, but you essentially play until your health is too low to beat anyone then you're stuck.

A solid deckbuilder, gorgeous art, fair pricing for extra content, optional ads that you don't feel the need to use, and enough unlockable content to make each run feel new.

"May 28, 2020","Why did my purchases disappear after the recent update?? I'm not buying everything again. I've spent a good amount of money on this game and to take it away without even an option to recover in-app purchases is a very bad idea on the developer's part. This NEEDS to be fixed.

I do wish there was a brief explanation of how each character worked because they all play very different from each other. After you defeat a monster they have a quip that alludes to the story.

"June 17, 2020","I rate this 4 stars based on the functionality of the app (rather than the gameplay) in correlation with the price. The price is high for the package that contains most of the characters (it jumped from 5.99 to 7.99 when I went to purchase...) I was hesitant. The gameplay is worth that 5.99, but the fact that you have to be ""logged in"" to access that content means that if you for some reason don't have access to internet, or have bad internet and fail to log in you can't use what you payed for.",4,"Giant NetworkJune 17, 2020Hello.

"December 17, 2020","I love this game so much, I would say it definitely makes you use your noggin when choosing cards and the array of different monsters can keep you on your toes. The art is great. The gameplay is awesome if you're into deck building games, and it has the kind of solo mission style that truly makes it a perfect as a phone game and not a physical game.

"May 7, 2020","My absolute favorite mobile game. I spend hours every day playing it, and have for the past year. I see lots of complaints about new ads being introduced to the game, but the fact is, they are extra, you dont lose out on anything you had before by not watching them and just skipping the new ad shops or the chance to reroll normal chests. Neither of those existed before, they didnt remove anything else to make room, and they are optional, just like all the ads. And the games playable offline.",5,"Giant NetworkMay 7, 2020Hi!

"September 15, 2020","The game is very unstable during ads in which it causes it to crash, and losing progress on top of it. Game is mostly shallow (though free), and a majority of content is locked behind paywalls. You only get one character to play with, and only one tree for bonuses so far. After filling that tree, there is no point in playing anymore unless you fork out for the other characters. Some enemy decks have balance issues as well.

But it seems that there are missing some QA work, speech bubbles not matching the voice lines, formatting that's weird etc. I'll probs buy the full game when I complete the free class, but I wish there was a trial of the other classes, just let me play against one 30 card deck with achievements disabled or something so I can get a feel for them before I buy.",4,"Giant NetworkJune 12, 2020Hello.

In order to play as any other characters other than the Knight you have to pay a dollar.

"May 14, 2020","Enjoyable, well put-together, bought the collectors edition. Only complaint is its very easy to get backed in to a corner. Much success is based on luck as well as skill on higher difficulties, with injuries carrying over between fights, and finding yourself low on health against a tough enemy when you are out of healing options can put up a permanent road block, wasting your progress and sucking the fun out of the game. If they added full health to the ad revive it'd be a 5 star game.",4,"Giant NetworkMay 15, 2020Hello. Team of ""Night of the Full Moon"". We apologize for any inconvenience caused to you.

"June 12, 2020","This game is definitely worth a purchase. Ads exist but do not impede the game at all, you dont even need to view them for anything as the decks you build are more than complete, easy to put down and pick up, games saves progress between each fight. Its a lot of fun and the story is just fun to go through. Multiple play throughs and even better with the complete edition for all the new styles. Highly reccomend to any lovers of card games",5,"Giant NetworkJune 12, 2020Hello. Thank you for supporting us! We appreciate it so much!

"July 21, 2020","The best mobile game I have played in a while The gameplay is fun and addictive (even though the game is quite easy but that is not necessary bad) while not being repetitive (if you buy the collector's edition that is definitely worth it) But where the game struck me is with its lore and its atmosphere. I just love fighting new monsters and discovering their stories that are always well written I highly recommend the game to you, especially since it is free",5,"Giant NetworkJuly 22, 2020Hello.

"February 19, 2021","Hi, I've been playing the game for a few months now and bought most of the dlc. I enjoyed the game and feel like the purchase was worth the price, and I have no complain for the past few months. With the newest update however, I found that there is no ads reward to be found after dying or finishing boss fight. Edit: Nevermind, I found the cause. I recently changed the cover to Collector's Edition and suddenly the ads reward stopped. It's working normally now after I changed it back to Classic.",4,"Giant NetworkFebruary 19, 2021Sorry for the problem.

NotFM is made one of those team that understands that smartphones are a worthy medium. It's a full fledged game with complex mechanics, an athmosphere, challenge, and lots of thought put in a lot of details. If you like card building games, dive in.

"October 3, 2020","My favorite. The replayability is real. I've been playing it so much, and actually purchasing things for it just to help the devs. It's totally playable without paying anything though. Ads are optional, though I always chose them because there were no automatic ads that were forced on you so I respected that.

"September 28, 2020","I've been playing card, RPG and strategy games for decades and so far this is the only game I've played which is not so overbearing as other card games which has tons of cards and dynamics. On the other hand it's not so basic either because you are made to think and strategize. If you want a game to help stimulate your mind without getting stressed out with the rules and details this is it!

If you want to play another character then they will delete the other one. 2. After fight with boss and you want to investigate the character, and you lose, there is no way to restore your HP. So it means you have to start over. 3. You can't save the cards that you earn. So, like I said. Not thrilled anymore.",2,"Giant NetworkNovember 18, 2020Hello!

Look and feel is both simple and well-designed. Love the character drawings and back stories. Ads only come out when you die (if you want to pop back to life lol) or if you want to double your gold winnings. Hooked and bought the collector's edition. and even the puzzles!

"October 9, 2020","Firstly, I have only played the first character (knight). I've only beaten 7 times and I'm still playing. The plot and artwork is good. However, there is a bit to be desired from gameplay. Card synergies aren't obvious and aren't abundant (with the knight), hopefully more cards relying on synergies will be introduced, such as Slay the Spire combinations. Some enemies are way too OP. They have cards that do massive damage. One enemy even copies your whole deck. I look forward to your changes!",4,"Giant NetworkOctober 9, 2020Good day to you! We are sorry to hear that you feel that way. Please do keep in mind that, our game is based on luck and chance.

"July 29, 2020","Game used to be fun, but now some of the cards and blessings aren't taking effect (again). Restarting the game doesn't fix the issue. The game also hates VPN connections and will freeze if you have one. Other effects also happen at the wrong moments i.e. ""end of turn"" and ""start of turn"", ""draw a card"". Game is no longer fun due to not working right anymore. Controls themselves are easy as hell to use, same with the GUI.",2,"Giant NetworkJuly 10, 2020We have fixed the problem！"

"November 15, 2018","This game might not be for everyone, but if you know of Slay the Spire and like it - its for you. One of the few games that I really love. Replayable and actually takes skill, with a nice progression system to change up the gameplay over time. A few time quality of life improvements that I'd like: - Better UI for the Courage and Reputation counters. Isn't super clear. - Have a separate 'New Game' and 'Load' buttons. I find myself resetting runs because I forget how the save mechanic works. Otherwise, great game. The developers responded quickly to an issue I have before, and it now works. 10/10",3,"Giant NetworkOctober 24, 2018we have reported this to devs. we will try best to fix this ASAP."
"November 22, 2020","One of the greatest single player games I've played. The stories wonderful and the replay value is excellent! Combat is thrilling, and building up you're character and dominating the enemy feels fantastic. The graphics are also very nice with the story. Just spent money on this game for the other classes, and I gotta say, if you guys ever make another game, I would love to try it out and see if it's just as good as this one.",5,"Giant NetworkNovember 24, 2020Thank you for your review ^_^.

"May 15, 2020","Very buggy, some cards don't disappear from your deck after you use them even though they have the Exiled keyword, let's you continue your run from the main menu even after you die.

"May 11, 2020",This will be my first review ever. NFM inspired me to share my thoughts. The setting is interesting (Fan of Grimm Fairy tales). I enjoy the mechanics (challenging at first; simple). Art style of illustrations varies (all good). A lot of grammar errors but understandable. VA doesn't sync with written dialogue (found it humorous). I have yet to try/purchase the expansions because I have yet to complete the base game (rn at Hard 3)- but I am considering of purchasing them.

"June 17, 2020",Was fine but too esay at the start. I was winning every fight just mindlessly playing cards with no stratage. I'm sure later on theres more of a challenge but I'm not gonna waste my time on the early stages just to get there. I suppose there needs to be a tutorial stage but I felt like I'd played long enough to pass it yet it was still too esay.

From the action-chaining of the ranger, to the magicians attacks which weaken over time/usage forcing you to ""come up with new tricks"", this game hasnt disappointed me once.

"July 19, 2020","Fun, strategic card game. However, drawbacks include overtly repetitious with no long lasting rewards (idea: receive a permanent card upon completion, it is a deck building game). The most aggravating element is the ads. Not because they have them, but because they do not work properly. The ads screw the players out of rewards by not playing correctly, or an inability to even try due to an ""Ad not ready yet"" message is highly frustrating. This would get a 5-Star except for these major flaws ...",3,"Giant NetworkJuly 20, 2020Thank you for supporting us! We apologize for any inconvenience caused.

No more than $10, it's a great deal, unlike some games that are pay-to-win or force you to rely on ads. The only ""flaw"" is there isn't a lot of story, but the hours of gameplay more than offset that. We need more devs like this, that offer great games and aren't greedy.

"January 12, 2021",An absolutely amazing game. With the variations of abilities and card selection that each character has makes this game very exciting. I've played every character and nearly beat all of the hard levels. The card selection can make or break your chance at winning at times which makes it interesting. But all you have to do is keep trying. As the game says failure is the mother of success. I hope I qouted that correctly.

"May 23, 2020","Purchased the deluxe package after a couple hours of play time. Only one things bothers me: Some text go over the allocated space and you can't read. some card description and icon tooltip in combat but most importantly, some epilogues, for example using the werewolf against red riding hood, the text in the epilogue is truncated. All the support is in Chinese(?) only so quite useless for a westerner user. Using an Honor 8x.",3,"Giant NetworkMay 25, 2020Thank you for supporting us! We apologize for any inconvenience caused.

"December 2, 2018","DON'T BOTHER DOWNLOADING! what a waste. Fun game, almost had me spending money to unlock the characters and then I noticed all my saved data had been randomly erased. So I thought no biggie I'll restart, following day (today) went to play and saw my data was erased again??!?! So I guess you have to pay to continue the story so why bother downloading this free preview? Not worth it and very frustrating waste of time.",1,"Giant NetworkDecember 4, 2018please contact us via FB page:https://www.facebook.com/NightofFullMoonCardGame  for solution"
"October 22, 2020","Fantastic game that really benefits from spending a little. The base classes, while flexible, lack the unique play styles of the other paid options. I personally purchased all the content (around 10$) to remove ads and unlock all characters, and it's been well worth it. Also between the difficulty levels, unlocked blessings/cards, and new monsters, there's a whole lot of replayability.",5,"Giant NetworkOctober 22, 2020We're so happy to hear that you have fun playing our game.

"July 29, 2020","Beautifully made game that doesn't force ads, but makes them strategically wanted for more gold or power ups. Not necessary at all, full game can be played without them.

"January 28, 2021","I love this game so much, have been playing it on and off for a pretty long time now. It's truly addictive and the different classes all have vastly different playstyles which i quite like, so there's always lots to do. The enemies all have this really interesting characterization with their lines and i really enjoy the amount of thought that's gone into crafting the world of this game. defs a lotta fun if you enjoy an intriguing (although a little expected) story",5,"Giant NetworkJanuary 29, 2021Hello.

"January 2, 2021","This is honestly probably the perfect mobile game. The purchases are small but unlock valuable things; there are no subscriptions; the lore and mechanics are fantastic. Really, I have no complaints other than that I want more! (Well, and a few pieces of the art are unnecessarily sexy. You encounter that much less than in most games, though.)",5,"Giant NetworkJanuary 4, 2021Thank you for your review ^_^. Have a wonderful day and best of luck at our game! ^_^"
"August 5, 2020","This game is very enjoyable coming from playing many hours of Slay the Spire. Gameplay is fun, lots of cool mechanics, characters and voice-acting are well done, and the story segments are a very interesting twist on Little Red Riding Hood. My only gripe with the game is that it is full of typos and grammatical errors. ""Maximun"" health, Perist instead of Priest, etc. Also, the speech bubbles do not always match up with the voice acting. If these things get fixed the game will be 5/5.",4,"Giant NetworkAugust 6, 2020Hello. Thank you for supporting us! We appreciate it so much!

"December 4, 2020","I stumbled upon this game while looking for something offline. The gameplay is simple but fun, the card combinations are interesting even on the basic class. The diversity of enemies as well as freedom to explore as much as you like makes this one of the best mobile games I've ever played. The fact that it has ads only when you choose to view them makes that even better. I really can't say enough good things. No regrets.

"September 15, 2020",Device: Pixel 4 Wi-Conditions: Incosistent Gameplay-wise pretty good. Some events feel pretty unimportant and the way most effects work it's a pretty brainless running down of cards with results in your favor where you don't have to think too much about the smartest possible play at the current moment. I didn't get too far yet since i only cleared it a few times till now. -1 star because the game seems to freeze sometimes and I have to restart the app like twice per run.,4,"Giant NetworkSeptember 18, 2020Thanks for the feedback, there are rich game content, such as collection, exploration, various activities.

"June 2, 2020",Honestly one of the worst gaming experiences out there. This is like playing megaman x just to figure out you can only go to one stage. I hardly ever rate things on google but the disappointing truth is that the game is way too short for one character. Having only one character to start is a slap in the face.

I am buying the DLC to suppport the Devs. Edit: Taking two stars off because DLC is not available offline even when you have downloaded it and signed on before losing connection.

You don't have to buy any garbage with real money in order to fully enjoy this from beginning to end. I did however buy the expansion and deluxe version just because I enjoyed playing this so much.

That's all I could access, & that was After watching Literally 30 ads 2 unlock the Magician version. I understand their need 2 make money, but if they were only going 2 have those versions be free, then it should Certainly take longer than 3 hours each. I'm not a pro gamer, in the slightest.

It's free to play and if you decide you want more then there are add ons - all under $10, and most under $3.

"August 26, 2020","i played this game for awhile before the big update, its still super fun but the requests for ads are pretty annoying. i paid 7 dollars for all the charcters and updates but im still not getting the full boss rewards, thats kinda messed up not sure if i will support any of your future games as it seems a slippery slope. Came back to this game and found out there are way more requests for ad views. I definitely do not like being handicapped because I don't watch ads.

"October 25, 2020","downgraded it for the DLC. very unbalanced, luck factor got increased and much less control over deck building in the new mode. would have preferred more complexity and control to the original mode over this.

Currently, one bug is preventing me from defeating Forest Spirit with Magician. When a counter sends one of my attacks back into my deck while other effects are triggering, the game freezes.

Equipment has passive bonuses which active. Spells cost mana, actions are buffs with their own currency to use. It's very simple. You can spend hours playing this, 4 easy bosses per each run and 5 hard mode with mini bosses sprinkled between. You build your deck how you want with never feeling too weak.

I even went as far as to shut my phone off and turn it back on to see if I would get my saved game back.",5,"Giant NetworkOctober 19, 2018Hi ty for your report. actually, this is not a loss. there are 3 chapters for each character. so once you finished the chapter 3, the adventure of this character was over. you can experience other characters or restart the adventure. btw, you can follow our FB page https://www.facebook.com/Night-of-Full-Moon-2217510205147246 to get our latest news."
"December 15, 2020","Stunningly good game with really good art, music, and story. It just sucks you in and I highly recommend. It's a rogue like deck building game with tons of replayability.

"January 6, 2021",You play the same game many many times. Difficulty is fictitious. It's not something you can defeat by clever playing. If you aren't dealt good hands or if the enemy deals ridiculous damage with many resurrections and you only have 50 to 150 hp against 800 hp (1st life) of the enemy's... There is no possible combination of hands you can play to defeat the opponent. So it's a money grab to upgrade. I will not spend on unfair games designed soley to get people to pay.,1,"Giant NetworkJanuary 8, 2021We are sorry to hear that you encountered some disruptions while playing.

"November 4, 2018","The game is great. It's interesting and has some really fun combinations that keep the game fresh. I do wish there were more than 1 or 2 endgame builds for each class, as I've only been able to find a couple broken decks per class, which makes variety in runs very limited. I had an issue with the change to the new character system, as the previous system costed more than the current one for all the characters, and Giant Network fixed the issue relatively quickly after being notified.",2,"Giant NetworkOctober 21, 2018I understand your situation.

Only minor problem is that there is no tutorial, you just jump straight into the game, and you can figure it out its not that easy but a tutorial would have been nice.

There is no concept of time limit, where if you wait, your HP will recover. The result is that you're faced with bosses who obviously have an advantage over you and to top it off you have no means to recover your HP. Stuck in an endless loop.

"May 11, 2020",Very good game but unfortunately it's complately unbalanced on higher levels. Impossible to win with last boss on level 5th. No matter which character I play. Disproportion between my health an boss is ridiculous 1:8 also in amount of cards picked at the beginning of each turn. Most annoying thing is that after few games you can tell what card opponent will play each time. Decks and order of play seams to be set not random.,4,"Giant NetworkMay 11, 2020Hello！Thank you for supporting us!

"June 25, 2020","Interesting game mechanics, great art, fairly interesting story, no nagging about getting and well spaced, optional ads. Also, it's not pay-to-win; the paid content makes sense as separate modules rather than feeling like a money grab.

"September 20, 2020","This game is amazing, even if you have never played a slay-the-spire type game before, this is masterful. I am surprised how many times I have wanted to play the game over and over again. Try this game, if you dont like the gameplay then you can appreciate the art styles, writing, and voice acting at least.

"May 2, 2020","Intrusive ads. All chars for $4 WAS a good steal for dozens of hours of content before then. Freemium currency added that affects main game with no choice. Do not like this direction and I hope it is addressed. Should not have to earn it or spend $$ if it's not an option and will affect your runs. Also, shuffling is DEFINITELY weighted and not truly random or even pseudorandom. Don't plan on seriously playing on anything past normal as the balance becomes quickly atrocious and becomes RNG.",1,"Giant NetworkMay 3, 2020Hello Dear Kuroki.

"August 19, 2020","Good game. It has more depth than first appears, yet it is easy to learn. The leveling seems is balanced and makes the game both fun and challenging. The story has a dark side to it (as all fairy tale genres do) that it moderates with humor but I still wouldn't recommend it for young children. This game is fair in its pricing and NOT a pay to play. There are a few mechanics that I have yet to figure out that maybe only used for additional paid content.",5,"Giant NetworkAugust 21, 2020Hello. Thank you for supporting us!

"October 20, 2020","This is a great game. Very balance, addictive and fun to play. It's easy to understand and can be as simple or complex you want it to be. The only downside is all of the special content are required you to pay. But if you really enjoyed this game than Trust me, it will be worth your cash. This is not Pay to Win, the DLC just give you a different play style and experience that's all.

"September 29, 2020","While on the hunt for a simple pick-up and play game, I found this little gem and was pleasantly surprised. I decided to hold off on getting the DLC parts and after trying it out- well, I decided to splurge a little and get everything I could unlocked and was pleased that it didn't cost that much, and added several more play-throughs for the future. I love the art-style, the little lines from all the enemies and the story that has been created here. I only wish I knew what the heck that last character option is and when it'll come out- and I haven't yet tried all of the classes yet. Definitely 10 out of 10.",5,"Giant NetworkSeptember 29, 2020We're so happy to hear that you have fun playing our game. Please be sure to rate us more stars if you like it.

"October 21, 2018","I thoroughly enjoy the game, however, I'm disappointed that once you're at a low level of health, and there's NOTHING but battles on your screen, you're stuck. You can't get out of it which means I've already had to delete my save and start over. I wish there was a way to earn potions for the players personal use such as exp., mana., or health.",4,"Giant NetworkOctober 22, 2018That's kind of the funny part of the game.

"August 25, 2020","I REALLY like the game play, but you need to buy the other classes to get the full experience. There are issues where it wont open if you are not online or are using mobile data. It also crashes sometimes. **story spoilers** It also seems like you should be able to save your grandma if you beat HARD VII, but even when all the memory shards are full for a class, theres no different endings. If you have to beat HARD VII on ALL the different classes to save grandma, they should say that.",4,"Giant NetworkAugust 26, 2020Thank you for your lovely comment. This means a lot to us!

"August 1, 2020","The gameplay is actually pretty fun and simple to learn. The art and voice acting, as well as the effects, are all well put together. The only thing that I dislike about this game is the fact there is no tutorial or explanations to get you started.

"June 12, 2020","Found out most of the ideas I mentioned were in the game, except soulbind. My bad didn't realise. Anyway the quantity and quality of content you get for your money is very high, at least the red hood diary dlc is. At first glance though, the game doesn't seem to have much, but that's because it focuses on replay value. As soon as you complete a story, the story gets updated. My only problem ATM is, the stars become useless fast. Hopefully there are more boards to unlock later on.",5,"Giant NetworkJune 1, 2020Hello.

"December 11, 2020","Honestly a great game that i often go to when i have nothing else to do and even if you dont want to spend any money the free part of it is still many hours of play time plus its pretty cheap considering the amount of content, sure after a while all your runs turn the same but there is only so much you can really do as a dev to stop that but overall its very worth a download to try it so I 100% say try it out!",5,"Giant NetworkDecember 17, 2020Welcome to join our community activities and have the opportunity to unlock new content for free.

"September 26, 2020","Firstly, card games are not my thing so this could well be the reason I did not enjoy this the slightest. I felt there was no storyline and you had to purchase additional content to make the game at least a bit interesting. I prefer buying a game and having it in full to in-app purchases you cannot really have proper control over. In addition, I beat a boss after entering the battle with a fourth of my health, so I think the battle system is not all that either.

"November 8, 2018",I liked this game until the ending. I dont get how my choices affected anything and my data was erased as soon as I beat it. Plus I dont like that the other characters have to be paid for. I also didn't get to unlock any achievements in the one play through. I want to be able to unlock all the achievements in one go. I dont want to go through the same story over and over again.,2,"Giant NetworkNovember 8, 2018hi dude, thx for the detailed comment. since our game is a roguelike game, players need to restart many times till get the whole achievements. if you can get all in one go, then our game loses its most important feature."

"October 26, 2020","While playing this game was amazing, I cannot say the same for the ""endings"" because there are no endings. You finish beating hard mode 7 times, get those fragments, beat final boss, read the monster story, get a little more insight and thats it. There is no story that comes after from your gameplay, just a collection of info on what happened before you started. There are no good endings. There are no good stories. You cant save grandma or anyone else. There is no motivation for your effort.",2,"Giant NetworkOctober 27, 2020Salutations!

The plot is a fantastic twist to the fairy tale and is amazing gameplay.The only concern is that there is only one free class to use last I played and that the priest boss is ridiculously difficult to beat unless you have the right artefact to help out.Would be nice if you could get the other classes by doing achievement and the priest is slightly easier to beat,4,"Giant NetworkNovember 18, 2020Please join our community activities and have the opportunity to unlock new content for free.

"July 26, 2020","Great-looking game, feels polished and solid. My main gripe is that without a limit to how much you can attack per turn, the game feels incredibly easy and strategy goes out the window in favor of unloading draw and attack cards. 7 of the 8 classes in the game are locked behind a pay wall, but I had no motivation to buy them because the free class offers little strategy or challenge. It's a shame because I think they had their heart in the right place, and they obviously put in a lot of effort",3,"Giant NetworkJuly 27, 2020We apologize for any inconvenience caused to you.

"October 3, 2020","Sometimes I get terrible luck in the game and get cards that don't mesh well with my style or deck. Sometimes the enemies are a hard counter to my deck and victory becomes impossible. in those situations the game is not fun, but they're rare. In 'full moon' you get additional blessings if you lose but there's no help if you die in 'Diaries' which is annoying. Overall though it's a pretty addicting game.

"June 23, 2020","This game initially showed promise with nice graphics, and deck building mechanics that have been a mainstay of board games. However after playing, it seems the developers did not bother to make improvements to gameplay as you advance.

Restart a new game is kind of the core part of Roguelike game. You will meet different monsters and build a different deck.

2. Don't pick up every card.

"February 27, 2021","just a quick warning for you guys here. i got the dlc for an older version of the game and after a bigger update, they removed my dlcs from the store bundled them up with a different name and locked all the characters i had unlocked again. since those guys are from china they might just pull that one again.",3,"Giant NetworkMarch 2, 2021Please send your UID and GPA to our email: nofmgame@hotmail.com.

"July 10, 2020","My only problem is that everytime I 100% the content more achievements come out! And it's not even an issue because I love it! Just oh so subtly heartbreaking and invigorating at the same time. This game is fantastic, have been playing damn near since it came out and I'm happy as a clam with every penny I've used.",5,"Giant NetworkJuly 13, 2020Hello. Thank you for supporting us!

"December 8, 2020","Best game i have played for sure.. Have been trying to find a good mobile game for a long time and I have to say this is not it. This is not a good game, not even a great game. It it THE BEST GAME. It has a steady difficulty curve that never feels overbearing or unbeatable yet just out of reach to make me change tactics on the fly at a good pace. Honestly I am glad I found ""Night of the Full Moon"" and can't wait to see what is yet to come. Thank you glorious people for this game.",5,"Giant NetworkDecember 9, 2020Thank you for your lovely comment. This means a lot to us!
