The game forces you to discard all remaining cards until you reach the maximum allowed at the end of the turn. There are deck and card options that will cause duplicate or extra cards to generate on an attack or action. This causes a bug during the discard period. The game will only allow you to select two cards to discard, preventing end of turn.",4,"Giant NetworkNovember 27, 2020We're so happy to hear that you have fun playing our game.

My main gripe is that without a limit to how much you can attack per turn, the game feels incredibly easy and strategy goes out the window in favor of unloading draw and attack cards. 7 of the 8 classes in the game are locked behind a pay wall, but I had no motivation to buy them because the free class offers little strategy or challenge.
