The game forces you to discard all remaining cards until you reach the maximum allowed at the end of the turn. There are deck and card options that will cause duplicate or extra cards to generate on an attack or action. This causes a bug during the discard period. The game will only allow you to select two cards to discard, preventing end of turn.",4,"Giant NetworkNovember 27, 2020We're so happy to hear that you have fun playing our game.

The boss level is hard to do with the cards they give, one small decision on what you want to upgrade can change the entire game.

387,"July 26, 2020","Great-looking game, feels polished and solid. My main gripe is that without a limit to how much you can attack per turn, the game feels incredibly easy and strategy goes out the window in favor of unloading draw and attack cards. 7 of the 8 classes in the game are locked behind a pay wall, but I had no motivation to buy them because the free class offers little strategy or challenge. It's a shame because I think they had their heart in the right place, and they obviously put in a lot of effort",3,"Giant NetworkJuly 27, 2020We apologize for any inconvenience caused to you.

389,"June 23, 2020","This game initially showed promise with nice graphics, and deck building mechanics that have been a mainstay of board games. However after playing, it seems the developers did not bother to make improvements to gameplay as you advance. The deck building aspect is severely handicapped with little opportunity to customize the deck, and at higher difficulties, they just clutter your initial hand with weak cards which are difficult to remove. Move on and look for other games.",1,"Giant NetworkJune 24, 2020Thank you for supporting us! We apologize for any inconvenience caused.

392,"November 5, 2018","The lack of sufficent healing tiles and sudden strong unpassable enemies that combo off of it's own resource ment that I had a good story line going that fizzled and wasted my time and only frustme. This one experiance has left the whole game feeling sparse and one sided, especially due to the inability to play any thing but the knight for free. Just a simply disappointing game.",1,"Giant NetworkNovember 5, 2018Hi, I am coming late. 
Restart a new game is kind of the core part of Roguelike game. You will meet different monsters and build a different deck.

I will give you some tips here. 
1. You can save fountain until your HP at a very low value. 
2. Don't pick up every card. 

Once you got fun or passed the game, please leave us a five-star.",giant networknovemb hi come late restart new game kind core part roguelik game meet differ monster build differ deck give tip save fountain hp low valu pick everi card got fun pass game pleas leav us five star,[1]
394,"October 3, 2020","Despite the many clear issues that the other reviews have pointed out; I am not giving it 1 star for said issues. Instead, I give it one star because in the first 20 minutes I attempted to play the game, the game froze literally every time I tried to fight an enemy, and the app would automatically close. I thought maybe it had something to do with my phone, but all of my other apps ran smoothly as they should. This game is doomed for dissapointment.",1,"Giant NetworkOctober 9, 2020Thank you for your review ^_^.

And our HP can be as high as 120 if we are lucky. Three turns. We have three turns top to deal 300 damage. For the knight, ranger and wizard this battle is just not possible.
