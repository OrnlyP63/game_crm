It's got great gameplay and aesthetics and just works so well. Unlike other apps, this doesn't have ANY intrusive advertisements. There are only optional ads every boss if you want to double your rewards (which I choose to watch everytime). The progression in the game is just right, unlocking harder modes as you go as well as cards and effects to balance it out. Each playthrough gives about 30 mins of gameplay. Great game!","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

Small hits are countered by ""take X less damage"" but this can be countered by just buffing each small hit.

You'd go from easy games to almost unbeatable without using hero skills (which have cooldowns based on how many people you kill). The increasing scale means that if you used a hero skill to defeat an opponent, you'd have little to no chance of defeating the next enemy.","Rated 3 stars out of five stars","null"

Only phone game I ever spent money on. However it can be riddled with (easily avoidable) glitches, the main glitch i have found is the game offering me 2 of the same blessing but it doesnt stack. An example being lightning fast reflexes (the one where you dodge and deal 6 damage) only dealing 6 damage if the game offers it to you twice. However other than that i do love the game.

I think it's unique and quite enjoyable. However it is possible to run into problems with purchases and the customer support for it is really really bad. They want you to join a group which has a Chinese name and description with a Chinese app and to join the group you have to answer a question but the question is in Chinese and it was hard enough to use google image translate to recognize the text on it and on top that when I finally understood what it said on the description of the group I learned that the ""support hours are between 10 to 18 o'clock"" are not helpful one bit because it is not said whether it is in Chinese time zone or not. Seriously this game has over 100,000 downloads and the devs don't even have a support channel for non Chinese people. Edit: Turns out you have to click on the purchase button once more for the game to register that you've bought it. Just spent 45 mins trying to get to the support for a fix for something so simple that I had no idea to fix. The support needs to improve a lot.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","null"

You only get once class unless you pay, but once you get a hang if it you can beat the entire game with it. The games gets more and more complex as you advance and play the story again and again with multiple bosses, enemies, and choice aspects which require some thought and planning. You have to be able to build a streamlined deck and have synergy between your cards while working around the page limits per chapter. There is some grind, but its not bad and the game can get very spammy. Really fun game you can spend a few minutes or hours playing. Would recomend.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","null"

You cannot have more than a specific number of cards in your hand at the end of your turn. The game forces you to discard all remaining cards until you reach the maximum allowed at the end of the turn. There are deck and card options that will cause duplicate or extra cards to generate on an attack or action. This causes a bug during the discard period. The game will only allow you to select two cards to discard, preventing end of turn.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkNovember 27, 2020We're so happy to hear that you have fun playing our game.

Damage you take remains after each battle and while you sometimes can health after battles depending on the forks in the road there other times where you wont get an opportunity to heal. I didn't like that I had to resurrect a few times because I started battle with such low health but even worse is when you resurrect you begin with the health you started at before. pointless.","Rated 1 stars out of five stars","null"

It's way too easy even on hardest difficulties. The playthroughs started feeling same after three or four runs. There isn't enough variety in how your journey looks like even when you pick a different class. Each time I go through the same exact motions. There isn't a depth of meaningful unlocks outside the runs. I unlocked all ""stardust"" bonuses right away, and new blessings for completing a run are not exciting, most of them are weak and don't change much. It would really help to be able to travel to different locations, besides Forest and Graveyard, to make runs feel more varied. Unique side quests, hidden bosses, puzzles or an option to risk the entire run just to unlock some strong cards would make it more interesting. The Castle DLC also has only one path and little variety. Why not give us a choice of visiting different parts of the castle.","Rated 3 stars out of five stars","null"

You only get the one pack and then the rest of the game has to be completely bought. The boss level is hard to do with the cards they give, one small decision on what you want to upgrade can change the entire game. It ridiculous that even after farming and killing each monster in every level you still cannot buy cards or anything to upgrade the cards. The expansion packs of course are only for purchase. I am dissatisfied.","Rated 2 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkApril 22, 2020Hello, We are sorry that you do not like the game but we thank you for your feedback.

I've paid for the ranger class so far and I don't regret it. Only question I have is..i got an in game message saying something about new mechanics and an apothecary class. I was just wondering when this update is going to happen. The new mechanics sounded awesome and if apothecary is as poison oriented as the Ranger can be, it's going to be awesome too.

It's very atmospheric, there were no annoying ads, and the puzzle minigame was such a treat. I keep on installing it again whenever I miss it.

Never affects gameplay though, just back story. This is a rouge-lite deck building card game. There are very short progression loops, after beating the game, you get achievements, and your game resets, allowing you to try to get a different deck and strategy, and win against a different boss. No overall progression though, so if you are into that, this probably is not the right game.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

Nice variation in playstyles between classes, and even a single class has several builds you could go for. On top of that the encounters and shop offers are somewhat random so there's replayability there. Boss/enemy difficulty can vary wildly though, and with some classes it's easy to get into a situation where you can't lose, but you can't win either and the battle just lasts forever.

Just have it were you can toggle on and off for X amount of cards and X amount of blessings of each rarity.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkNovember 24, 2020We're so happy to hear that you have fun playing our game.

The stupid game mechanism is you meet enemies based on your deck, counter you with other ways arounds. Enemy and challenge lvl are faked, they are not nothing scaled against with cards you encounter in the game. E.g. challenge lvl nerf you and buff the easy enemies in easy lvl.

The best Game I´ve ever tried on mobile. Good gameplay and I really like the artwork and the cut-scenes which led me to a few notes. I wished there was a gallery section, could be placed somewhere in the Achievement section, where you could re-watch the prologue, epilogue and whatnot. During cut scenes, where several pages are used, like the start of the ""Diaries Adventure"", it just cut to the next page on it´s own. I would prefer the option to move on to the next page at my own leisure as to take in the artwork/story better. There are some flaws in the english translation, and when you fight ""Little Red"" she speaks Chinese at the end of the battle, even though it has been set to english. These flaws do not ruin the experience, but it would be an improvement to have them fixed. I hope that this game gets more publicity and support, so that more updates and expansions will arrive, and the story can continue. I also like the puzzle section, please add more. .","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

It offers a surprising number of viable archetypes for building decks into, an active community and a chatty development team.

I got to the Witch (one of three mega bosses) and was fine. The comabt was challenging, but I eventually emerged victorious. Now, let's talk about the Werewolf (one of the other mega bosses). Well, let's just say every turn he regens 20% of his max health, has an item that allows him to survive lethal damage oh, and he will constantly make you choose from a list of effects, one of which is to make him automatically regen 40% of his max health. Why would you pick that, you ask? Because after awhile is the only option let to you. And after reaching level ten with cards that are seriously on point (a revival effect too I might add) THREE TIMES and getting my butt slowly worn down THREE TIMES over the span of 30 MINUTES and not being able to do anything because my deck is literally 60% prank cards, I'm deleting this game. I can't get to the endgame because of the Werewolf, no matter how good my cards are or how many passives I have, so there's no point to keeping it, which is really a shame because it was a lot of fun up until then.","Rated 3 stars out of five stars","null"

Wish I hadn't done that!! Basically you get to points in the game where you can't upgrade and you literally can't beat certain levels or even heal enough before you battle to win anymore. I've done the same battles over and over and tried all different things, but at some point they just hammer you to death and there's absolutely nothing you can do except die. Repeatedly. Sometimes it'll let you almost kill it, then you die again. I'm over it.","Rated 2 stars out of five stars","null"

But after some turns there is a stuck at the first real endboss (werewolf) which every time get the right buff to let the player loose. So if u could finish him, he either get immortal, immune to damage, immune to effects, you have to discard your hand or you action points are blown to zero). so u every time get him below to one hit, than he is buffed to definitely survive and own you within two rounds (buff like 40% health or ""you cannot 0lay a card this turn"")","Rated 1 stars out of five stars","null"

I just don't get the gameplay. You get 2 cards (or more with upgrades) per turn... and you play those 2 cards (or how many you have). There is zero decision making. Sure, you choose the cards and upgrades between fights, but why do I even have to play the fights when there is no decision involved? Just automatically play the damn cards!

Every enemy is voice acted and every card has very nice art. The only gripe I have with this game is that it isn't totally balanced. The soul eater and the knight class for example only really has one viable build. Soul eater can only really do an absorb build and knight can only really do an artillery equipment build (for the higher difficulties)","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkJune 7, 2020Hello.

The classes have distinct styles from each other, and within. I have purchased all the DLC and the found the prices reasonable. One of my best mobile purchases. My only 2 complaints are that there is not a higher difficulty, as I have played this game so much that the top difficulty rarely poses a challenge, and that the difference between the strongest and worst classes is huge. I always find myself coming back to this game.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkOctober 19, 2020Thank you for your lovely comment. This means a lot to us!

Intuitive, fun, and engrossing. My only real complaint is that the Headless Horseman's buff that stacks piercing damage to the player at the start of each turn is MASSIVELY over powered. Normal damage would be fine but 20+ piercing damage to eat at the start of each turn while the Horseman gets 2 resurrections per battle as well? Come on.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","null"

The art is great, the setting and story is wonderful, and the whole experience of adventure really sets this game apart. The first time I have ever paid for in-game content in a mobile game. This new genre of build-as-you-play deck games really brings a lot of re-playability to an otherwise stale CCG market. The rouge-like-ish style allows for players to try new tactics and explore different play styles without having to invest in dozens of random card purchases. Play this game. Then buy the in-game content to add new characters and stories. It is worth the $6.00!","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

The story is interesting but not that big, which honestly is preferable. There is no unnecessary padding. Everything about the base gameplay is great. However for the Diaries 'mode' I've encountered a slight issue, mainly with the mage. The only way to beat the Hard mode that I've found is using a very specific (and rare) blessing which relies on my deck being able to apply the chilling effect. Adding more varied powerful cards to the harder difficulties could solve this.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkJuly 10, 2020Hello. Thank you for supporting us!

Every class plays differently, and as a card game player in general this aspect keeps me coming back. However... I cannot say this game is perfect. Considering I paid for the full version, having ads in there even as a way to revive or get more gold takes me right out of the game. Worse, if I do take advantage of it I feel like I cheated. While I can understand having ads for people who haven't paid a cent (you worked hard, you deserve to get paid), those who actually shell out the money for everything in the game (people like me) frankly shouldn't have to so much as see the word ad.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","null"

If you want to beat the really tough enemies in hard mode, you're going to need luck to have good cards in your deck and the right cards in your hand on the first turn, resulting in more than a few resets. But at the end of the day, it feels satisfying playing your entire deck and doing 400 damage in 1 turn when you feel like that shouldn't be a thing.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkNovember 3, 2020We're so happy to hear that you have fun playing our game.

The other classes can't be unlocked otherwise. Plus the werewolf boss fight is near impossible unless your are dealing 30 damage consistently every turn for twenty turns straight. I got a good defender build and the wolf couldn't break through my armor. But I couldn't deal enough damage to compensate for his 20 health heal he does every turn. Than my deck got muddled with prank cards and it was done after that.","Rated 1 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkOctober 23, 2020I’m sorry to hear that.

I have only one complaint and that's the translation from chinese, now I dont mind the ocassional weird turn of phrase or how all the monsters insist on saying ""human beings"" instead of just humans, however the wording on some cards just makes it so you kinda have to guess what they do the first time you use them. This is however very minor, and once you learn all the cards it isnt really an issue. Overall great game, excited to see if the devs add new content in the future.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","null"

NO MICROTRANSACTIONS!! You can play the first story all the way through as much as you want for FREE. You earn gold (and can't buy it!) with skill and good choices to buy better cards. You do get double gold for watching, like, a literal 10 second ad, but there are no intrusive, mandatory ads. I'm GLAD to watch the ad.  No pay-to-win. Once I beat all the bosses in that story, the ""in-app purchases"" are buying more characters and stories with totally different cards, rewards, and strategies. And there's 8 difficulty levels for each character.   I wish more games were like this where you choose to buy content instead of advantages.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

They will feel very rewarding and pleasing at first but after you climb higher in the ranking ladder, everything seems to focus on who have a better deck of cards. This game solved that problem by removing the PvP aspect.

This game is a gem I played a LOT for 2-3 days and I bought ALL the classes (6 euro).So for a free to play player that has only 1 class does it get bored? The answer is it depends if you are playing for 30 minutes a day no it won't because every time you restart the game you can follow a different path to build your deck. The replay ability of this game is awesome. With only the knight class I tried several decks (full damage,always picking the action cards etc.). If you want/can spend 1,20 euro and buy a second class recommending the dark mage or the magician you instantly unlock a new play style with new several ways to build your deck. In conclusion the game is a gem worth the 6 euro, worth the 5 star review, very nice graphics, very nice music.

Great story, so many paths to branch off into, and a steady difficulty curve. The game IS short and the pay wall exists with little different to offer between the different classes but I don't mind too much. Ther's still enough there to change your playstyle to make the game feel different enough to add to replay value. The completionist in me loves all the cards (and there are a ton), achievements, and the skill tree. The casual gamer in me loves that I can just pick the game up or put it down whenever.

The initial, free download is more of a preview/demo, making only the Knight class available. For the other classes and game modes, you'll have to purchase them as DLCs. It is worth it though, aside from supporting the devs, the gameplay is varied enough on different classes and even when repeating the same class.

The characters are unique and fun. There are some problems however. The game is not balanced incredibly well there are alot of enemys who can be very strong. The dullahan is my least favorite enemy in the game. He has three lives with a total of around 300 health, but each time you empty a health bar you take the lethal damage you dealt, which can make this enemy near hard.

But if you developers are reading this, make at least 2 classes to unlock for free, for us cheap-skates.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","null"

Advertising shop, watch an ad to reroll a card etc... I paid for DLCs and don't want to see ads.

When connected to wifi there's the option to watch ads in return for double gold after boss fights. Game immediately throws you into it and you kinda have to figure things out yourself. The graphics and audio really add to the atmosphere and each dlc class plays very uniquely. On the other hand it seems to be crashing more recently. Not sure if due to recent android update. But the auto save mitigates progress loss.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

The audio and visuals are stunning, the style has the cute yet eerie feel to it, even the enemy characters are interesting and of course the gameplay is enjoyable as well. It's a bit of a shame that there's only one free class, but with such high quality I think its fair.

One point to note is if you intend to play other classes you will need to pay about $1 per class.

If you guys wanna make it pay2play game, better put it on paid game instead of putting paywall in your games. This can cause your game to be rated lower since a lot of people hate this kinda thing.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

In order to ramp up the difficulty for new game+ the devs added artificial difficulty i.e. the bosses dont actually play smarter they just have insane amounts of health, do unspeakable damage and heal for the amount of damage they do every round. This makes the game so unfun because at that point, it just becomes trying over and over until you get godlike rng. Really disappointed with this.","Rated 3 stars out of five stars","null"

The only suggestion I would give is to make the oponents more challenging in hard mode as they all seem to do little to no damage or their gimmics are obscured by the fact that you often build decks that easily go infinite or one shot them before they can pose a real threat.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

Diverse card selection and synergies makes the game incredibly fun and replayable. Only downside compared to other AAA roguelike is the replayability after completing the game / achievements. Other roguelikes would have dailies and leaderboard to encourage further playing. After that point, there's really no incentive to continue playing. As such I'd be very excited if another expansion were to be released.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkJuly 1, 2020Hello. Thank you for supporting us! We appreciate it so much!

Initially, there's the challenge of getting various amounts of courage and such to unlock stories. Then it actually increases in difficulty.

The visuals are ok and the story is passable, even though the pacing and payout is really lack luster. Sadly though the game trips heavily when it comes to game play. The mechanics of actual card usage is never explained and can become over whelming quickly, especially with an non-existent helpful UI layout. Other games like Endless Abyss handle enemy AI and card balancing so much better than this. Enemy AI passives can be massively unfair and clearly poorly thought out.","Rated 2 stars out of five stars","null"

It's bugged and I put a good amount of time into setting up my deck to get it. Please fix it and, if you can, give me my achievement. Really well-designed cardgame when you get to the bottom of it. A lot of clever choices, divergent from most other card games, such as giving you control over what is in your deck by withholding certain cards (your deck reshuffles every turn, not just when it runs out) and enabling you to setup more powerful turns and combos. The card design is generally really good, encouraging synergistic and efficient decks with ludicrous combo potential. Currently it's held-back by: - Incorrect tooltips that are either poor English translations or do not correctly capture their effects (e.g. Headless Horseman will reflect sub-lethal AND lethal damage). - Poor or broken English lines read by the great voice actors they got, which seems like a shame. - Small bugs and strange interactions, usually involving doing things too fast. - JiuJitsu. I hate this card so much. If you play this game you will to. Luckily it's rarely used but it falls into a small family of extremely uninteractive cards present within the game.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

You only get 1 character to begin with, but once I had spent hours on the starting character I bought the rest of the characters. Definitely worth the purchase because the other characters open up so many more options and possibilities. One amazing thing about the game is that ads are optional and not forced upon you. There are neglible issues such as sometimes text may be too long to show up or there are small typos (due to translation).","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

Not only is it a very well-developed card game with fun mechanics and interactions, but it is all entirely contained within the OFFLINE game; all cards are available through the game, and there is no trading and purchasing cards required. It has really high replayability within the first free class, like, hours of gameplay. I purchased the expansion and i am really excited to play it.

I won't pay for it but, I totally respect the developers for it. However, it is a little confusing that the payments are for individual things and not just an overall game buy.

I've been playing it pretty constantly the past two weeks. Ads are only in the game to either double the money from bosses or after you lose to try again. A side note for those who might want to know: on death if you watch an ad to receive you get to pick a buff when you come back, but if you don't watch the ad you go the main menu and can just click continue to try the fight again without getting the little buff.

It's very repayable, great mechanics, astounding art and atmosphere. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the limitations on classes. Now I know everyone needs to make money and I'll spend money on a game I like, but to limit the experience to just the warrior is very detrimental to the player. You don't have to give every class, but something more then just the warrior would be great. Give the player a way to unlock another class like ranger or mage.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","null"

It feels slightly like the binding of isaac without being a clone or rip-off. The combos you can make are extremely satisfying, the sound track isn't annoying (I find that most mobile games very repetitive). I love that the characters talk. The artwork is charming. And most importantly, It's hard without being unfair. You sir have made a top tier game! My only issues are, the card descriptions aren't always clear. I still dont know what equipment slots do. (I beat ever boss on normal.) And I want more content! MORE, maybe a Cinderella story or anything from a brothers grim novel. ANYTHING! I will be looking for more games like yours.

The fact that every adventure develops a different deck, hence different gameplay is challenging and fun. However I only rate it 4 stars for two reasons: 1. Why bother to make 4 classes buyable for a buck each? You either love it and buy the game or you don't. And there should be a short description for what you get when buying the ""full version"". 2. The game is just burning through the battery! Please take some time to optimize the consumption or implement a battery save mode. After playing for 20 minutes my cell is burning hot!

End boss is decided by having a greater Reputation or greater Courage. I chose all reputation options, and ended up with just as much reputation as courage. This is happened multiple times while I try to Target a specific ending. Most of the game is random, and you can change the outcome just by closing the app and starting it again.

So much that I paid for the additional content, which is well worth it. The most recent update literally just made another paywall to switch adverts off.

I'd give it higher stars, but there are a couple of the final investigations that are simply ridiculous. I was able to finish one, but it took an hour for the stars to align. The last one is even more crazy and near impossible unless you have a very specific deck state. A shame since it is such a unique game on the store. Would love to see another like it with more variety and balance. Edit: I was excited to see a balance update and returned to card slinging. However, the Priest is still the same.

Awesome game with random events and forked endings. Tons of content, especially after purchasing additional characters which costs a very reasonable price for a mobile game.  Few suggestions for devs: 1. Remove the ad for resurrection which grants a free blessing this breaks the immersion of a very immersive game. Make the blessings a baseline because sometimes i die on purpose just to get those blessings. 2. Remove the ad for getting double reward from a boss kill. 3. To compensate on the removed ads introduce some random ads every X encounters. 4. Add option for In-App purchase to avoid ads but still enjoy their in-game benefits. 5. A cool feature would be a Nightmare mode where you have to complete the game in one sitting without dying. Leaving the game mid-fight or dying would wipe the current progress.   One of the best games i've ever played on my phone, keep up the good work!!!","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

Good enough to buy all the DLC. Infinitely entertaining, with just the right balance of strategy and luck to keep it interesting! The swiping the cards up and the smooth animations both contribute to the FRICTIONLESS game play! Although, they might want to double check the spelling and grammar in few of the cards. 😁","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

I don't usually like card games but the gameplay is so great. Adding to a great story. Looking forward to seeing the following : a. Realtime PvP battles b.

However, this game tends to freeze for me quite a bit. Normally it would only freeze once or twice during a session, however, I'm at the final boss in part if the DLC and it keeps freezing right as I'm about to kill him. I've restarted the app 7 times at the time of writing this (only including the times its crashed during this fight). I really love this game, but the amount of freezing is truly ruining it.","Rated 3 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkJuly 27, 2020Hello. Thank you for supporting us! We appreciate it so much!

When you first play the first character (the knight) is free to use and okay through as many times as you'd like. I did buy every character for this game. And I've yet to be bored of it and I've done a run through of every character at least once if not more. It's hours and hours of constant play even for a game you intentionally need to play multiple times over. And I enjoy the challenge to unlock all the achievements in the game as well.

The first true boss is impossible to defeat if you haven't fought enough battles and earned enough to power your deck up. The delta in difficulty between this character and the previous foes is EXPONENTIALLY higher. And it's a very time consuming battle that can't be won if your cards can't do enough damage in a certain amount of card draws. It's a mathematical impossibility. That in itself is no biggie. IF you had the chance to go back, fight some more battles and upgrade or make changes to your deck. But this is where the game is BROKEN. You cannot go back and do anything. You can only read defeat screen after defeat screen reminding you of the obvious, ""Your deck needs to be streamlined"". Thank you captain obvious! Fix this and it's a 5 of 5 easy. But right now... if you value your time. Don't bother.","Rated 1 stars out of five stars","null"

You only get one class to start with, and while the rest are cheap, it's even cheaper that you get locked out of 7/8ths of the game if you don't pay up, even more so if you go past just the classes. Knight is fun, but exclusively knight isn't. Giving everyone just one extra class to start would make this game so much better.

The mechanic of needing to replay the game multiple times allows for some truly fun runs and good challenges even if you've beaten the role more than once. The ads in the game are also not in your face and completely optional to watch as well as the dlc for the game. Great game overall in my opinion.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

Not only is it really entertaining, immersive and enganging, but it also has a beautiful story which basically is a""twist"" (more of an extension) on the red riding hood story. I can't write a review on this without also mentioning the wonderful graphic design, music and just sound effects in general which together make an atmosphere that I haven't seen the likes of in a game before. It must have taken a lot of effort to make this and I really do not understand how this game not only is free, but also has NO ads... Actually zero. I was looking for an expansion pack and found something about a DLC and it said I had to log on, but when I did it disappeared. I need to support the creators in some way, please tell me what happened. I will now look for more info on this game and maybe there is a community somewhere, I just love it so much.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

Believe me, it's good, I did not expect it from a game like this. I hate and love everything this game provides, I don't know how to properly explain it, there is just so much content within this one free version and the story and combat and characters feel like there's something so special about each and every one of them. I then realize this game is only free to play now and have to pay for more content which I think is a good love by the developers. In my honest opinion I think this game would be worth buying if there was an option for multiplayer and I would most likely spend every dime I can on all the different playstyles if I see this. Sorry for the mixed review, I just don't know how to feel, keep up the ""good"" work. PS I tend to have a reputation of ""killing"" games when the developers take my opinion so take caution and godspeed.","Rated 3 stars out of five stars","null"

Once you've gotten to her, you can't do anything else but fight her. It's not like you can go off and grind then try later.

Other than that, this game is rather enjoyable and hard to put down. Sometimes, the enemy cards go by too fast, or the combos I count on go buggy or are unclear, but the system is relatively forgiving, and it's no reason not to play at least the free parts. If I had the money to spare, I would be unlocking all of Riding Hood's classes and playing through them, let me tell you.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","null"

Well, kinda. Much like another game I love, Slay the Spire, you build up your deck from the basic beginner cards that each class has into a synergistic monster of whatever direction you take it. Beyond that, it has a great aesthetic, both music and design wise, as well as some simply very good voice acting work done. I genuinely reccomend throwing the devs some love by buying the in app stuff. It's just such a fun game.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

Why do I do this? Because I'm tired of the dishonest tactic of calling a game ""free"" and it only be 20% of a game. The other 80% is locked behind a paywall. This is not a ""free"" game, its a demo. But since they insist on calling it a ""free"" game then here's my review. It's too short and too easy. I completed the ""Entire"" game in a little over an hour. In contrast other free games last up to ten times as long.","Rated 1 stars out of five stars","null"

If youre a fan of Slay the Spire you'll enjoy NotFM. Very similar experience overall. My only real gripe, is the translations are spotty in places and make some cards confusing at first. The voice acting and music are amazing though! Art style is gorgeous, and the MTX arent bad. If you like the game, throw the devs 6 bucks to get the collectors edition and most of the characters.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkDecember 17, 2020Hello！We're so happy to hear that you have fun playing our game.

But the latest update is super greedy from the developer. Including a mechanism to allow you to watch advertisements in order to get things you would have gotten for free in the previous version is simply making the game worse and killing the immersion. Do not make the November 2018's update ! Also the new mechanism that allows you to replace a card at the beginning of the game (the only good point in this patch) in exchange of one advertisement view does not work. I liked this game.

However, I'm pleased to say that this game breaks the mold in this market. The artwork is stylized, gameplay is simple at face value and grows more complex overtime, and the game has so much replay value large in part by the amount of cards and classes in the game. This is one of the very few mobile games I was more than happy to support by buying all the (generously priced) DLC.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

Definitely enjoyed the gameplay more this time around & will be thinking about buying the other classes. Previous review: I was having fun until I had to keep fighting enemies with low health near the end of chapter three while playing the free lady knight class. I started a new adventure several times trying to get past this point, but found it impossible without more opportunities to heal between harder battles. On my last attempt before I deleted the app, I beat the demon king at the cost of a lot of HP, & couldn't defeat the other enemies I was expected to fight afterwards. It's a shame, b/c I would've loved to buy the other classes if the game hadn't become so frustrating. The graphics, voice acting, & different cards are really great. I just want more full heals between battles.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkNovember 5, 2018Hi did you pass the final boss?
I can give you some tips about saving HP and you can try it again
1. Save fountain until your HP is at a very low value or before boss
2. Save bandage if you are about to level up (it will recover all HP)

While if you passed the game, please come back and leave a 5-star to us.
More tips you can find on our Facebook."

You can't create a problem, provide a solution for profit, and then expect your already paying customers to just be happy about it. It's not about the money.

The different character classes are quite fun, and I like the new hard mode extension. Honestly, though, most of my decks consist of using cards that let me draw more cards so I'm drawing my whole deck out each turn (and again before the enemy gets another turn, if I'm playing magician and using magic pocketwatch). Especially fun for that is the blessing that makes mana cards take effect twice, since most of them let you draw cards.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

In the sea of garbage known as the play store, a game so genuinely fun to play like this is so rare. The free knight class is plenty of fun. i was also pleasantly surprised after coming back in a few months to see a bunch of updates. bought the character bundle immediatly. it's hard to not compare this game to slay the spire, but devs have done a really good job to make notfm a game of its own. can't wait for new content updates! my credit card is ready lol.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

Cards are interesting, and player is able to combo cards in order to maximise their effectiveness (in some cases damage output is a bit too high in my opinion). However my rating is severely lowered because of the limit of the content because of purchasable characters. Far as I know, it used to be way more fun and way more entertaining because of more playable (free) classes. What I'd suggest is to leave (as it is) one class available and allow player to unlock two other through achievements or simply completing the game, and leave rest purchasable.","Rated 2 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkNovember 6, 2018thx for the detailed comment. actually we indeed had the free version (Beta version)before. but due to policy change of Google play. we had to make some changes. besides, we also have to spend fees on the further development and need some necessary funds."

If you dont get the right cards, its impossible to win. So you basically just keep scrolling dice and hope to get lucky. If youre unlucky, erase all of your progress and try again. With no capacity to build an actual custom deck, its basically flipping coins and hoping to get lucky with each fight. Mathmatically it can be impossible to win.

But it's a little imbalanced. I'm having some incredible difficulty with nun, but completed it with magician and little witch, both the same difficulty. Game difficulty builds rapidly, to the point where you wonder why normal difficulty is so damn hard. Some cards in the shop have way too high price tags and are impossible to get. Every class has a weakness in one or two specific enemies. You will probably lose if you don't chance upon any recovery after one of those fights or level up from it.","Rated 3 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkNovember 14, 2018hi please follow our FB page: https://www.facebook.com/NightofFullMoonCardGame and DM us directly."

I've never played something that had all the elements of being interesting, novel and also sleek. The game is not a huge battery drainer but has the perfect amount of beautiful art and animation to make it addicting. I picked it up and spent three hours on it immediately. I don't think the new content of the other classes is worth paying for, though, maybe if new characters and especially new plots and bosses were added as well. Ads at the end of a fight or chapter could be a way to make money. I found the gameplay slightly unbalanced in that some play styles were super overpowered (tomahawk + poison/lightning spam) while some made it difficult to defeat bosses. It didn't take away from my enjoyment of the game, though! To anyone considering it, give it a try.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

You only get 3 characters to play but the wrest of 5 you can buy for very cheap each having their own play style and unique cards that let you choose up to 3 different decks or just murge then into one. I will recommend this game to anytime but you have to be patient and try to get use to their game mechanic, its worth tho.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

Also, every class play differently, and each class have several viable paths you can build into. The theme is strong, stories about the monsters and the world setting is immersive.

I have enjoyed card games and always liked the solo (non multiplayer) adventure playlists. I was a bit confused after playing throught the knight that I didnt unlock anything else so I tried again. After the second time I unlocked the next character....or so i thought. It doesn't make me happy to live in a time that even progressing through a game you have to pay for it. Sure it's .99 but still why are game devs doing this. Not worth the time.","Rated 2 stars out of five stars","null"

Now it does. 0.99$ (£0.74) for the US to remove Ads, but £1.89 (2.51$) for the UK to remove. A huge insult on a good game Back in the day, the Knight, Ranger, Nun and Magician were all unlockables. They now appear in store, likely meaning they no longer can be. If you can ignore the high charges to play, the game is otherwise entertaining, though perhaps a little easy.","Rated 3 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkAugust 18, 2020Thank you for supporting us!

Gameplay gets progressively harder with some peak points, that is until Hard 7. At that point the game just cheats you.

Update: still no response from the devs, the Google return window is closed, and I spent $5 on nothing.

The Werewolf and Priest in particular need to be adjusted so that they're not impossible to beat. if you're unlucky enough to draw the Werewolf as a boss in any of the hard settings, good luck. His regen ability, immunity for 1 turn, plus defense against 1 attack over 8 damage each turn, PLUS negative card effects each turn AND over 200 hp makes it nearly impossible for a wee mana user at even Hard Level 2.","Rated 3 stars out of five stars","null"

I've completed 2 classes. I dislike and like their ad function if that makes any sense. Using it will make the game easier (double gold, shop refresh, etc) but it feels a bit like cheating sometimes. The DLCs are somewhat pricy. I'm thinking about purchasing the Red Hood Diaries though.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkJuly 10, 2020Hello. Thank you for supporting us!

3. Use skills, which is at the left bottom corner of the combat page

Unfortunately, the Ranger is a fundamentally weak character. And powerful Ranger decks are the exception, not the rule. The point is if the game is good, you won't have to search on the internet for extreme setups.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","null"

The music and voice acting are phenomenal. The gameplay is a cross between little red riding hood and slay the spire. I gladly paid the 5.99 to unlock all of the classes. My only real complaint is that the ui can be a little weird sometimes. Some sentences are broken off because the screen is not big enough to show them (and I am playing on a s10+).","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

Simple rules with decently complex gameplay mechanics. Worth the extra couple bucks for the add-ons like a new play mode and extra classes. One of very few mobile games I've actually wanted to get all the achievements for. Only issue is some localization/English translation weirdness from time to time, but pretty forgivable. If you like this one, check out Pathfinder Adventures too (based on the board game).","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

Combat is intuitive and you can take your time to read the text of played cards. As a free to play you get one class to play in normal mode or in seven increasingly difficult modes (so there is some good replay value). Extra cards unlock as you progress through the game and purchases are never pushed. Ads are optional and can only be watched after beating a boss (to give you some extra gold). would definitely recommend for fans of this style of game.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

However luck plays too much of a factor and the game is totally unbalanced. It's like they released it without testing it. Easy mode is not challenging, and hard mode is almost impossible. After barely beating an enemy you are healed for an insignificant amount; and then are expected to beat a character who can literally kill you in the first turn.

I know it sound wierd but i'd like a way to unlock those characters just by simply defating every boss and maxing out the bonuses ( if you do this you unlock the way to unlock the characters) or make missions for it like ""Have 10hours of playtime"" or ""Kill a boss in One turn"" ""or ""Deal 200 Damage in one Turn"" with this the game would have a way better experience for players.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","null"

You can tell that the developpers put alot of work and passion into this one. This is a mix between a roguelike RPG and a Card game (think Slay the Spire). The RNG makes each run feel fresh. One thing I enjoy is that if you die, you do not restart from the begining, the run ends when you simply cannot defeat an enemy with your current cards and decides to start over. The difficulty is well balanced. It might be hard at first but it will get easier as you'll learn the mechanics. The classes are all different and fun to play in their own way (and only a dollar each). There's alot of achievements and cards to unlock.

The game play is also very good and has lots of replayability with different builds and wacky combos. The one thing that I don't particularly like is that you can't play any of the bought classes offline which can be really annoying, I know that its probably so you can't get them for free but it still kinda stinks.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

My suggestion though is that skill trees must be reset every time you start a new game.Every game as your character levels up you will earn a skill point (which can then be used to learn certain skills from the skill tree). Although this game is worth the money spending for, I would really like if you will give a milestone gift like a ""hero ticket""-free class demo that can only be used once every ticket.","Rated 3 stars out of five stars","null"

People who bought the full version shouldn't need to have immersion ruined or get bonuses for watching an ad. Card effects are not always clear (looking at you sticky) and story can be muddled from poor English translation. Despite all of the above it's a really good game. It just needs a bit of polish. Remove the ads for premium customers but leave the bonuses and get a good translator.

I really enjoy the artwork, I'm a huge fan of dark and creepy/Tim Burtonesque whimsy...The whole style and playability of the game is fantastic. I also love the fairytale storyline. The game is challenging, fun and keeps my attention which many game apps do not. I also like the option to choose outcomes of a story after defeating a level, some things I choose are good, others are not...It creates a level of luck which is always fun in my opinion. However, just some ideas: put the book of cards deck on the main screen. I had to dig around quite a bit to eventually find it under achievements and then in the inconspicuous ""i"" symbol in the top left corner. Also, maybe just a general instructions manual? I only downloaded this yesterday but I still do not fully understand what all the cube symbols are under myself, what the sand timer means, what mana represents, etc. At times the game is difficult to follow. A question I have also is this, when I play a non basic card in a round, is it gone forever or can it be played multiple times later on? Or only if I bought it rather than being gifted it? Because there are some cards I'd like to hold on to to use against higher levels later on, but I'm afraid that once I use it, it will be out of my deck forever. Also, not sure if you're using a translator or not, but not all the cards make sense grammatically. Just my two cents! Overall, really beautiful game and I love being given the opportunity to check it out while it was free in the app store! Two thumbs up! :)","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","null"

Unfortunately, after that, I unlocked all the skill tree, finished half of the achievements and that was that. Unfortunately, it seems like there is a lack of progression for f2p players. If there was a way to unlock a different story, other classes, or even an extended skill tree I would be more inclined to play more.

The game seems simple but that's not the case as you find new enemies that have their own strategy that can counter yours. The card system is very simple but is fun to play especially when you reach the end of every game you play. From its battles to its deep and amazing story of the Forest, this game is what I myself would call a masterpiece. I really recommend this game to those who like card strategy and unique story. Although be aware the story isn't really revealed until you reach the end (depending on certain circumstances).","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

To the reviewer who said Night of the Full Moon is easy if you know what you're doing, I say then provide some instruction so I can know what Im doing. The game is very difficult while youre trying to get a handle on how to play it. Just for one of many possible examples, it's not entirely clear what an ""intersection"" is in game terms. I can make a wild guess that it's a junction point of some sort, but beyond that, I have no real clue. Yet I am offered the choice to ""go to the next intersection"" quite often in the game. The upshot is that Im always unsure whether to choose it, because I dont know if I'll be calling down harder enemies upon my head, prematurely shortening the game, or what else/other. I simply dont know all of the effects of many of my choices in this game, and that takes some of the strategy--and hence, the joy that comes from successfully strategizing--out of the experience. Beyond that, though, I dont have much to complain about. I happen to like the fact that the characters' text and voiceovers are slightly different. Nothing is added or removed between them, the same thing is just said in a slightly different way. However, some other stuff, like character descriptions, intro text, or even the game description here on Google Play, could definitely benefit from a native English speaker's attention. Anyway, this is a really good game at core and well worth anyone's time.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","null"

Setting a lower price might increase your sales count, just saying.. ^^ Uninstalling since there's nothing else to do; pvp in any way would be very nice.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","null"

What's available f2p is limited but enough to decide to pay for some content. Graphics are great, the gameplay is well done, and the mini games and content is fun. Is it hard in some places, yes. But you can figure it out and enough guides online to help you along. Is there a huge replay value? Not really. But I like a good end game. I like to casually revisit maybe once a month or so but that doesn't diminish the value.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkFebruary 26, 2021Welcome to join our community activities and have the opportunity to unlock new content for free.

Some side quests would be nice, that would allow you to gain a bit more XP and coins.

On hard mode the enemies all show up at once and there just isn't enough healing. Not to mention the enemies seem to have extreme increased health AND high draw power, the game now seems incompletable. And what happens after you die? You are given the chance to ""resurrect"" with a small buff of your choice... but not before having to watch an ad first. If you don't watch the ad you can still ""resurrect"" without watching but no buff is given. The devs DELIBERATELY made it harder so you have to watch an ad and give them free money in order to get anywhere in the game. I used to be able to clear the second chapter easily but now the game is impossible without external help. Cheapshot by the devs. I would give it 1 star for ruining the game but the game is fun, just not very fun when you keep losing due to lack of healing options and 8 straight enemies in a row. If they were smart enough they would allow us to watch a certain anount of ads in order to unlock characters. But i guess they weren't so pretty much the game is ruined. GG NO RE. Dead game.

I hate mobile gaming, but I work 12h shifts and got nothing else to do at work. This game is so good that I even played it a few times when I'm home. Just one question... Is it a bug or you can't beat the wizard with a nun? God knows I tried it a lot... He keeps turning into a statue and it's a never ending round because I can't kill him in one turn. He also removes poison when he turns into a statue so I can't stack it to 100. I find mistery man way easier than the wizard, and it should be the other way around. I am amazed I haven't broken the game because I went 600+ in armor before I gave up.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

No tutorial or explanations given about how to progress throughout the game, but you get the hang of it quickly. It reminds me of Dark Souls, because once you're dead, you have to start the whole game from the start. It's pretty sad that you're also losing all cards. It has a lot of room for improvement and it really needs to be made less frustrating. Cards are given randomly so it's all about luck and a lot of skill when it comes to passing chapters.

When killing a Year Boss and watch a video to double your gold, the ""added gold"" turns to +0 (after accepting also don't add anything). 2. Killing regular ""Bosses"" give you great amount of exp but, Year Bosses are like a regular encounter. 3. When you throw at them the ""fireworks"", even if the prayer said that they are afraid, the firework doesn't do anything aside the 15 points, in that case, why the prayer?.

I would say the game captured quite well on the deck building ccg part. But as far as I have gone as of this review (Hard IV). The hard mode is unfortunately getting onto the unfair side instead of challenging though. As the normal enemies gets harder, certain play styles would gets completely invalidated with no alternative detours (e.g. non-healing deck against headless horseman.

It must be praised that there are no gems or gacha garbages. The IAPs are just DLCs adding more story modes and classes, and I feel they generally worth the money.

A great card game, countless deck strategies combined with perks and every game is a new adventure/challenge. I'd also like to highlight the art, voice acting and even some lines the characters make, they all add up to the wide spectre of pure awesome. The game is very worth playing and dropping a few euros for other classes and some unlocks is worth the money. I hope there will be more updates or maybe even extensions of this game.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkAugust 10, 2020Hello. Thank you for supporting us! We appreciate it so much!

Id give 4.5 if I could cause there are some minor translation errors that make some cards descriptions not match its effects. Its always a fun little game to come back to and its definitely worth the money to buy the classes. The ads are alright cause its only to revive or get bonuses after bosses or you can pay to remove them. Best card game on the market.

At first i didnt get a few things about it but this is a pretty solid game. It partly relies on chance but if you build a bad deck then its your own fault for not winning. I played as much as i could with the free character until i wanted to try out new cards and then bough the next 2 characters which are only a dollar a piece, i will be buying the last 2 shortly. Very good game over all. Minor translation issues but none that break the game whatsoever.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

Good GUI and UX, great variety of cards (some would benefit from a more precise wording, though). Yet, it's a bit on the easy side. Even the so-called ""hard"" levels do not ramp it up, except for the very last one that required a few runs to win.

Maybe I have to join the forum. After playing it some more, I find it very addictive. Because the boards are quite short, the ending of the chapter or the game is just around the corner which keeps me motivated. I love that is it not a true rogue game and you do not have to start over if you die. Simply watch a 30 second add, get a blessing to help you become stronger and return to the screen where you chose the opponent. Perhaps you could get stuck and have to start over, but most of time you eventually win. There is such a large variety of cards and monsters to keep things interesting. Sometimes you can't get the ideal cards and have to strategize what cards will help you beat tough bosses when your cards are not what you would like. Lady knight is free but there are 4 bosses to beat at normal and 8 levels on hard difficuly, so one could be playing for a long, long time. Even though, I am playng the same character, after 6 plays and probably 15 hours, it is still fresh, The main problem is once you start playing you don't want to put it down until it's finish, which is bad for sleep.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

Lots of variety, and very fun. It can be a little frustrating when your character lacks certain critical cards and thus simply can't reach the upper limit of strength, but it does add replay value.  That being said, perhaps its because I'm using an old Galaxy S3, but the UI has some critical game breaking errors. This usually happens when there are ""too many cards"" to select from. Which can occur when... You are discarding from more than 6 cards, selecting a card (perhaps via ""prophecy""), or even selecting a card to imbue (perhaps for Zeal). I've had a number of characters simply abandoned on the last level just because I couldn't actually progress anymore since the UI would give out.   Hopefully it works better on newer devices.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","null"

HOWEVER some English texts are confusing and I really wish there was an infinite mode to challenge you to reach as far as you can as I find my self completely obliterating some runs and I would highly enjoy seeing how far I could get in an endless run situation. My last criticism would be the lack of upgradable bonuses for all runs.

While the execution of the gameplay is wonderful and the art and audio is amazing, the game seems to suffer from some balancing issues. It doesn't seem very fair if an enemy can kill me in one or two turns consistently when I'm at full health. The dialogue options also seem to appear randomly which can cause it to be difficult to gain the amount of courage or reputation you need. May be a very worthwhile game if some of the enemies can be balanced out.","Rated 3 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkOctober 9, 2018Thanks for your suggestion.

My biggest gripe with the game is that some runs can just stop dead in their tracks because your current deck just isn't good enough to beat whatevers blocking your path and you have to either start over or fight the monster or boss over and over until you get lucky. This isn't a horrible problem once you start to get used to the game but it can be annoying.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","null"

Very enjoyable, although I thought they made the knight super op (Blessing: Scorching Flame + Cheese Trap added with equip Bizarre Runes and Bear traps and the enemy kills themselves in no time). Bought the dlc and trying out all the different classes. They put in effort to make each class feel pretty distinct. Takes a little bit of getting used to and what kind of cards you want to go for, but not that hard to figure out after the first chapter.  Only thing that really bothers me is the typos. ""Maximun health"" is the biggest offender since you see it all the time.  Would love to see an endless version and some more to do with the skill tree (if you can even call it that). It's very barebones and you can fill it out in like 2 playthroughs. I thought there would be a skill tree per class, but there isn't. Would love to see something like that implemented in the future.   It's a fun game that you can pick up and leave with some elements of strategy.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

I've been everything, unlocked all achievements and still go back to replay constantly. It's a game that is well tailored to mobile gaming. I wish there were more like it. While there are other roguelike card games, this one is a bit more arcade like, in that it builds up quickly, each class is widely different, and you are not limited to very low energy amounts.

But there is just not enough free content to truly test the game. The game randomly generates each chapter (or level), though there are set encounters that'll happen no matter what. You are only offered one free class to play as. And sadly, after multiple playthroughs, this one singular class does not offer enough gameplay deviation to keep the player invested in the long term. and the skill tree doesn't help with that.

A slay the spire style game with a wide variety of cards, blessings(buffs) and enemies/bosses who are voiced. The game features choices ingame which impact on the final boss you can fight (to my knowledge there are 5 final bosses, though i am not too far into the game). There is also a 'skill-tree' which enhances your experience and allows for more power. On top of all that there are different decks you can start off with.

Best free game on mobile, but still a pile of sh. Go play ""Slay the Spire"" instead. Speaking of ""Slay the Spire"", one thing developers of it understand is the rule of defense. In order to play such game you need defensive cards in addition to offensive ones. This is not the case for ""Night of the Full Moon"". Defensive cards are hard to come by, they don't do their job very well and half of the time you can't even play them. Why wouldn't you be able to play them you may ask? Simple! The enemies are broken. It is felt the most with bosses. You can't use actions against them. You can't use items against them. And the attacks won't save you from all the damage they deal. Still, this is the best free game on mobile that is not a puzzle. Just don't fight the final bosses.","Rated 2 stars out of five stars","null"

The graphics, sound, and the gameplay are smooth but...what do you do when you're faced with an enemy directly counter to you? The witch in particular and the elf queen seem to hard-counter the base class you're given to play. I'm particular the witch has a card that, when used, will always return to get hand and you cannot mitigate its damage and she possesses an item to return her to life on death that she can use over and over. Maybe I'm bad at dealing with the caster enemies but it seems a bit unfair to let an enemy resurrect ad-infinitum of you're unlucky enough to not have equipment destruction immediately available.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","null"

The developers puts out new updates pretty often and even tho you habe to buy the DLC/nee classes, it is worth it since it's cheap, yet functional and opens up a new gaming experience. My only issue is the power ups you unlock with stars. Once you unlock them, they are just a permanent boost with no change. I wish there were more of them and that they have to be put intp sets which you will then decide what set is good for a certain class. 10/10 game.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

There are a lot of bugs. Regular app freezes, cards mechanics that don't work (several list ""Draw 1 card"" but do nothing), and the latest seasonal patch's bosses don't double the gold coins after watching an ad like it says (doing so clears your reward). Just a lot of examples where play testing wasn't thorough.

While games feel short on Normal, later Hard challenges will last far longer due to having to attempt fights multiple times. What hurts the fun to me is that certain enemies are specifically designed to punish certain builds. And since only one or two builds are really viable for each class, you get times in Hard where the game always makes you fight a boss specifically designed to ruin your build, at which point you just try to get lucky over and over again.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","null"

Every class has any different options as to how you build your deck. With the main being attack focused, defense focused or equipment focused. Attack can have to do with normal attack cards, action cards or magic cards. Some playstyles include special tactics like the proper implementation of trap cards or negative effects on the enemy AI.

To comment on the response, even though its optional, its still leaning towards pay (or ads) to win.

As soon as you collect a few action cards that let you draw more cards you become practically invincible. There's an easy fix for this: Only allow action cards to draw more cards. This way players can still use that play strategy without it being super over powered because they're limited by their action points each turn. The translation is horrible (especially the voice overs) which sucks cause the game has a lot of story elements","Rated 3 stars out of five stars","null"

Пять полноценных классов (один бесплатный, остальные по доллару) стиль игры которых кардинально отличается, четыре концовки и много веселья. Отдельно хочу выделить звуковое сопровождение - оно просто восхитительное. Музыка, звуки, голоса - всё на высоте. Давно я не встречал настолько затягивающей одиночной игры на мобильные устройства. Одна из немногих игр, на которую я не пожалел денег.   Excellent rouglike card collecting game/ The closest relative IMO is Slay the Spire (although this game is inspired by some other game). I really like the game. 5 different classes (1 free and others are $1 each), 4 endings and lots of fun and challenge. And the game sounds nicely! Music, sounds, voices -the atmosphere is FANTASTIC!

I wouldn't mind it there were good instructions elsewhere, with well compiled explanations, but there isn't anything that I could find for particular issues I experienced. It's a big let down because it's quite important if you are going to succeed in the later levels. Good game, poor player support.","Rated 3 stars out of five stars","null"

Buying the character pack has also been worth it. You get entirely different cards. Taking your time, min-maxing and finding a strategy to become powerful enough to defeat the last boss in one turn is part of the main routine.

This is a diamond in the rough we've been waiting for. A solid deckbuilder, gorgeous art, fair pricing for extra content, optional ads that you don't feel the need to use, and enough unlockable content to make each run feel new. Minor downsides: slightly poor translation, some esoteric mechanics, and a bit easy if you're competent.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkSeptember 23, 2020Thank you for your lovely comment.

The gameplay is never fully the same, and the builds can vary so much from session to session. If you've played a bit and enjoyed the first character (and gameplay), purchase the complete set! It'll be well worth it in the long run, I guarantee it. I was actually surprised that the content was as cheap as it is.

The price is high for the package that contains most of the characters (it jumped from 5.99 to 7.99 when I went to purchase...) I was hesitant. The gameplay is worth that 5.99, but the fact that you have to be ""logged in"" to access that content means that if you for some reason don't have access to internet, or have bad internet and fail to log in you can't use what you payed for.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkJune 17, 2020Hello.

Still i wonder if the developer realized he called two different cards ""double strike"" (and one of them is in my opinion the second best card in the game after bolster). The luck component is fun and the game itself eliminates the deck building part of other cards games that required me hours and ultimately made me abandon those games out of boredom","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

The art style is wonderful and the voice acting is great! However, the cards you get are all governed by chance and if you constantly get bad hands...you're kinda screwed, especially as there's no literal way to go back and ""hoard cards"" (as your tips after death always say). The mapping of chapters is also confusing and there hasn't really been given a reason why after a time they jump you forward in the story.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","null"

The base game has enough content to keep you entertained. The in-app purchases are expansions that add additional story characters and deck building strategies. My biggest complaint is that the translation to English is weak in some areas and can be confusing to what power-ups and cards actually do. There's still a couple of power-ups that I am unsure as to what they do and don't consider them in my strategy. If translation were improved I'd rate 5 stars.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","null"

I'm not saying they are hard to kill, or require you to spend money to win, or require a lot of luck. No, the problem is they have unlimited recurring turns with immunity or recurring health buffs, so you have to whittle them down over and over & then hope to finish them off before they get their health back. I spent 15 MINUTES killing the damn werewolf. This game mechanic makes the whole thing tedious.","Rated 2 stars out of five stars","null"

The game has no tutorial 2. When showing what cards the enemies played, they flash by so fast I cant read them, so I dont know what the enemy is doing. 3. The written dialogue and spoken dialogue dont match, and often have very different meanings. 4. The player cant heal themselves when they desperately need to. I felt the bandage cards only came up when I was high on hp, none of the stores or the chests allow for things like potions, and it's very random whether you'll get a healing ability in game or not. This leads to me dying over and over because not only do I not get how to play the game, but I have to go into battles with 8 hp or something, when the enemy has 50, and eventually at that point I felt like no matter what I did I had to restart. If the game improved on these things I think I'd play it alot more.","Rated 3 stars out of five stars","null"

That has me so excited to play again! When this was broken, I did play StS on Steam. These are very different games. In fact, I prefer Full Moon because there's better visuals, audio, monsters, atmosphere, and an actual storyline. DLCs are affordable, and to my happiness went towards development of a fixed release. So, yay! Good job team.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

I've only beaten 7 times and I'm still playing. The plot and artwork is good. However, there is a bit to be desired from gameplay. Card synergies aren't obvious and aren't abundant (with the knight), hopefully more cards relying on synergies will be introduced, such as Slay the Spire combinations. Some enemies are way too OP. They have cards that do massive damage. One enemy even copies your whole deck. I look forward to your changes!","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkOctober 9, 2020Good day to you!

Also I beat the witch at the investigation and got there again but can't investigate anyone else. Why?

Please do add more chapters for longer run through. Happy to buy the additional the additional characters (only 99p each is great value) but I want to play for longer. Having played now for over 7 hours there are still new cards that pop up that I had not seen previously. Please IGNORE other reviewers who are suggesting adding adverts.

I know that sounds dramatic, but we all know the vast bulk of ""games"" aren't really games at all, just thinly veiled cash grabs. This is a game, well and true. You can spend a bit on upgrades, but none of it is pay to win. More like expansions to game play. If they were chargeing for the game, that would be scummy, but they aren't, pay nor not. Have fun eather way. I payed, and don't regret it for a second, and i wish i could say more.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkNovember 13, 2020We're so happy to hear that you have fun playing our game.

At first, I was impressed, but...once I tried the Hard modes, I am much less so. I have tried the Nun class in standard nightmare FOUR times now, and each time I'll reach a point where I can't win any battless. People on the same level as me have twice the health points, pick up about five or six cards per round, and will take over half of my health in a single turn. It's literally impossible to win.

It's fun, looks amazing, and has subjectively fantastic voice acting. Ads are unobtrusive and optional, and it is fully offline outside of initialization to access cloud saves. The gameplay is reminiscent of Slay the Spire as a deck-builder, but this game has far more classes and is arguably easier because of a lack of energy. That is my only complaint: the game allows invincible runs for skilled players, reducing replayability. Still, I love this game.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

I did my best to beat the game without using revives/ads but realized its impossible. It feels like they made it really difficult in order to force people to watch ads.

If i could rate it 10 stars I'd give it 11. I had to restart the story 3 times because i would dig myself into a spot that was impossible to get out of, I'd have 4 or 5 health with no way to increase health and start fighting a boss enemy. But i was actually happy to restart because i was able to mold my character and deck in a new and exciting way! I'm not sure how you actually made it a pleasure to restart my progress so many times, but i can't wait to play the next release of content, until then ill keep replaying what I've already beat.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

It's a deck-building games where half the fun is trying to optimize what you DON'T want in your deck.

I would understand if it were thought-provoking, but it really isn't. It's the same old tropes in humorously boring fashion. That being said, the game itself is actually amazing. The art is beautiful. The gameplay is amazing (at least until this last update which seemed to make it way easier). It is a very good game, which makes it all the more a shame that the plot has such shallow anti-Catholicism.","Rated 3 stars out of five stars","null"

I don't like that you need to be online to access the classes even after you purchase them which is to say. This is one of the few games that I do recomend purchasing the additional content for IF you play this a lot. That said it's a good time kill game. The fact that I can call something on mobile a game is impressive once again. I look forward to more from this developer and ideally they can fix the problem with the classes being locked unless your online. 4 out of 5. It does not have a lot of replay value after you finish the knight but like I said, the classes change that and being locked makes that a slight problem. People who have enough money to spend on excess data won't have a major problem with this. Over all I do enjoy the game for what it's worth and it is worth full price. If there is anything worth noting at all for the developer directly. This game drains battery like a beast. If it's possible to fix that, that would be great but I think that might just be a by product of the animation, size, and engine.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","null"

However, it is linear in all the wrong ways. When I got to a difficult boss, there was no way to back track. I tried a Dark Souls number of times but my deck and character just couldn't beat the boss of the first chapter. So while it wasn't a huge time sink to get there, no more than two hours, it still meant I had to start from the beginning and hope that this time around I could defeat the boss. Very frustrating. Beyond that the voices for the characters are fun, and I like that they have two or three lines they say to keep things interesting. If they had a store or back button option it would definitely be a 5 star for me.","Rated 3 stars out of five stars","null"

Anything you do is automatically countered and there's no way to win. They also grow all their health back after you first get it all the way down. The second time around they're even stronger.

However, drawbacks include overtly repetitious with no long lasting rewards (idea: receive a permanent card upon completion, it is a deck building game). The most aggravating element is the ads. Not because they have them, but because they do not work properly. The ads screw the players out of rewards by not playing correctly, or an inability to even try due to an ""Ad not ready yet"" message is highly frustrating.

You start off with a base deck and through events you are able to get more. There are also passive abilities which work nicely if you adjust your deck to it. The story idea is fun, bosses are mostly fun and interesting. I cleared the game on the hardest difficulty and still like it. Enjoyed it a lot and suggest you to try and see why.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","null"

This game allows you to continue to play on and it's great fun. And what they do present to you to buy is 1 buck for a extra character. Compared to other games that charge you , 30$, 60$ and up for a extra character, this is a amazing deal.

Only one things bothers me: Some text go over the allocated space and you can't read. some card description and icon tooltip in combat but most importantly, some epilogues, for example using the werewolf against red riding hood, the text in the epilogue is truncated. All the support is in Chinese(?) only so quite useless for a westerner user. Using an Honor 8x.","Rated 3 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkMay 25, 2020Thank you for supporting us!

Either make it so I can play offline with the content I bought or refund my money please...... Edit..... Great response team, I understand now its an authorise check, have to sign in before I can access the other classes, but can then go offline to play.

No time spent unnecessarily but at the same time you don't get rushed. Really well done. Only criticism I would have is that in the higher dmg numbers some tweaking needs to be done, I think.

Some events feel pretty unimportant and the way most effects work it's a pretty brainless running down of cards with results in your favor where you don't have to think too much about the smartest possible play at the current moment. I didn't get too far yet since i only cleared it a few times till now. -1 star because the game seems to freeze sometimes and I have to restart the app like twice per run.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkSeptember 18, 2020Thanks for the feedback, there are rich game content, such as collection, exploration, various activities.

Good sound and art. Game never frustrates by always giving options. Con: Just too easy untill possibly the very lategame encounters. Replay value is low. Resource management is forgiving. Maybe playing different classes adds novelty, but you can't try them before buying. Game mechanics are clean enough to be understood after a single playthrough. However, it would really help to have some kind of tutorial. Uninstalled after enjoying.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","null"

This game exceeded my expectation in so many ways. The way the game is designed, each run will almost never be the same due to the element of RNG in Blessings (Passive) & Cards (in Shops) & the sequence the enemy appears. Unlocking the blessings through the run throughs in different difficulties give you a sense of achievement. Base game (free) - a bit restrictive as there are only 2 available classes, ""Knight"" being the base class and ""Magician"" as an unlockable. Add-ons - this game allow you to gain access to additional content for a ONE time fee, unlike most games nowadays, monthly recurring fees are always daunting and annoying. In this game however, you can buy additional content such as: 1) Expansion pack with extra heroes (Nun, Ranger, Witch, Werewolf, Apothecary) 2) New game mode ""Diary"" 3) Additional Bonuses (Piggy Bank) 4) No Advertisement (Worth in terms of time) 5) ""Soul Hunter"" Class 6) ""Mechanic"" Class Each item listed above requires individual transaction but overall is pretty affordable and in my opinion worth the money you are paying for. May I also add, all the different classes are quite different on their own and have a different play style and I have no clue how they make it so different in each of the classes and make them all so fun to play through. Other good thing about this game is that it is completely offline, meaning you can play it literally anywhere - on flight (not that you can fly nowadays), in elevator, down in the dungeon, you get the drift. The graphic & music is also top-notched. I have always been a sucker for card games/deck-building games, and have tried dozens of card games from Yugioh, Hearthstone, Gwent, etc. Those games are fun but this Deck-building game is completely different in its style, combining with dungeon crawling & opportunity cost of items selection and resource allocation. We all need some diversity at times to keep things spicy and I think this game will do for others. I don't write a lot of reviews, but I hope I give you guys my perspective of how much I have enjoyed playing this game. I wish there are more future contents for this game in terms of classes and story modes, this game definitely left me wanting more!! Thanks for the developer for making such an incredible game and I am glad I found this during the COVID lockdown period where my holiday is ruined, but this game kind of make it at least a fun Christmas!","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

I understand their need 2 make money, but if they were only going 2 have those versions be free, then it should Certainly take longer than 3 hours each. I'm not a pro gamer, in the slightest.

Lots of replay value though, probably for around 60h as it is. Game plays with cards. You build a deck with what you find in the game. Even the game progression works with cards. You pick one of three progression card. It can be ennemy, boss, shop, special events that let you power up, etc. Combat is turned based and easy to understand. You get pretty bad ass by the end of the game especially if you built a good deck. Great free apk.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

I've kept it quite a long time in my phone, but I think the recent version has more bugs than before. Took very long time to download new update, and when update was done, kept on indicating that I have network problem although my connection works just fine.

I think you should make a much longer campaign, because once I'm finished with it, I'm not really that interested in playing it again, even with a different class, if I don't see the possibility of developing a deck to its maximum possibilities. Playing the game again would be a chance to develop a new one aiming to a different style of combat, for example, but that can not happen in the state the game is in right now. Another important feature I would love would be a kind of arena where you can battle monsters (or other people, although maybe that would become troublesome to handle with all servers and stuff, it's kind of hard to do if your game wasn't developed to be an online game from the start) with the old decks you created in your older campaigns (maybe put a choice whether to save it or not for the arena after you've finished you adventure). Or -and this I think would be the best choice that could make your game one of the best I've ever played on my phone- you could update the campaign periodically, letting the user choose among one of their old decks to play the new chapter, adding new pieces to the story and buiding up the difficulty, up to a point where the principal motif of the game would become building the perfect deck, after you've uncovered the whole mistery of the story. Okay if you add all of that I'm definitely going to pay for this game and give it five stars.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","null"

I only rate 4 stars instead of five because while this game is amazing, it does get really repetative and after probably sinking about 30 - 60 hours total into this game im burnt out. I need something that changes the gameplay more than what it has. But it has been fun and I do not regret any time I put into this game, may even reinstall after a few months to play some more.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","null"

It just sucks you in and I highly recommend. It's a rogue like deck building game with tons of replayability. The base free version gives you a really good introduction to the game (you can play through on one character) and then if you buy the DLCs, you get all the additional content. One of the only games I've actually spent money on, so that should tell you it's high quality.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkDecember 17, 2020Thanks for the review.

There's like 7 characters, but only one is available for free. Even so, the one character offers alot of content (something like 500+ cards). Even after you beat it once, there's several bosses and increasing difficulty. If you have played Slay the spire, this is similar to that kind of gameplay; you progress through fights/monsters while building up your deck. You then pick up artifacts/treasures to further strengthen your deck.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","null"

Before you let that scare you away, hear me out. There are no ads, even if you pay nothing. The only benefit paying unlocks is more ""classes,"" but this is in no way mandatory. It's really just more content. In fact, some of the classes you unlock seem to make the game a little harder. If you do decide to buy anything each class is $0.99 extra. If you want you can bundle them all, at least at the time of this writing, for $3. It's definitely worth the $3 if you like the starter class. As far as the game itself, the animation/graphics are good, there is no lag (at least on my Pixel XL), the sound is high quality, the assortment of choices for each class ensures replayability even for the single starter class (the bundle adds five or six more classes with different cards and abilities..

The controls are really easy too, just drag and drop, how easy could that be. The graphics are sooooooo nice they're not realistic, exaggerated but simple. It doesn't rely on the graphics or how it's actually executed but it's more focused on the content. But there's still one little thing that I want to point out. When I went offline I couldn't use the characters that I bought and I was trying to finish that round. So devs, what I'm basically asking is to make the characters available to use for those people that bought it legally. But generally this is amazing. This game can go to different places. I mean it's just a suggestion but can you guys add a pre run shop or in game currency that can be used to buy cards so it's unlocked or even gave a shop where you can set up a run where you have all sorts of cards or something like that. But anyways good job DEVS! good work for making this game so fun and simple I will support this game and I'd like to leave this quote here- ""Simplicity is beauty"".","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

You can't focus on early levels to earn more gold and you can't buy better cards without gold. I've restarted multiple times and keep getting stuck on one of the bosses whose decks and abilities/armor far outstrip any cards you've even had the option to buy (option, not opportunity, because you don't have enough gold even if the cards were an option). I could see downloading again but not until some of these things are fixed.","Rated 2 stars out of five stars","null"

But it can get boring real quick. Some enemies have a buff to heal 20+ at every turn (such as the werewolf) and you have to choose to heal 40% of his health later on. Which can get very unfair tbh for the player. I realize it takes patience, but you have to realize it gives the werewolf an unfair advantage. I personally have tons of health, attack, and armor cards but even then after a 20 minute long battle I just don't want to play anymore because it's the same thing over and over again. In the end, the werewolf wins unless you have a twist of luck that allows you to kick his butt. I'm still going to play the game..but just not as much.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","null"

The game is really fun. But there are 3 ways to recover HP : 1. Get the bandages card 2. The witch's apothecary 3. Level Up. There is no concept of time limit, where if you wait, your HP will recover. The result is that you're faced with bosses who obviously have an advantage over you and to top it off you have no means to recover your HP. Stuck in an endless loop. Because after each death, the HP doesn't recover!! Can't progress, have to restart the story!","Rated 2 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkApril 1, 2020Thank you for your feedback.

Normally I don't mind paying a bit of coin for games I like, but this one is sneaky about it. The only playable free character is the knight. Several other characters are ""locked"", with the option to log in. I don't trade my personal information away lightly, so after some deliberation I logged in, giving the game permission to access my information. And all this got me was the ability to see the price of each character. Nope. Uninstalled.","Rated 2 stars out of five stars","null"

Impossible to win with last boss on level 5th. No matter which character I play. Disproportion between my health an boss is ridiculous 1:8 also in amount of cards picked at the beginning of each turn. Most annoying thing is that after few games you can tell what card opponent will play each time. Decks and order of play seams to be set not random.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkMay 11, 2020Hello！Thank you for supporting us!

Very intriguing but short story based on your actions and other playthroughs. Every new playthrough is enhanced by cards you gain through achievements even if you don't finish your run. The multiple classes all play very differently yet seems to be well balanced and worth the cost of a couple of coffees. The pay off for some final bosses are definitely worth it especially if you have a keen eye for details.

It has more depth than first appears, yet it is easy to learn. The leveling seems is balanced and makes the game both fun and challenging. The story has a dark side to it (as all fairy tale genres do) that it moderates with humor but I still wouldn't recommend it for young children. This game is fair in its pricing and NOT a pay to play. There are a few mechanics that I have yet to figure out that maybe only used for additional paid content.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","Giant NetworkAugust 21, 2020Hello.

I love the art-style, the little lines from all the enemies and the story that has been created here.

The one shot spam cards in the right order is so sweet! I have purchased 3 more roles, but I was devastated to find that at a very early time the story ended. Felt so prematurely finished. I really hope there will be an update to prolong it's wonderful story but for now and only for that I will be going 4 stars, due to spending money to play more and finding out that there is no more than 1-2 hours of playable material. Again, very nice game, though.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","null"

Deck building rogue-lite game, pretty similar concept to Slay the Spire. But this game is really original. While you might find similarities like poison and weaken, this game contains many new mechanics and ways to play. After you discover OP card combos, you can cruise through the game till the advanced bosses. Then it becomes a fight of OP mechanics which were really fun and challenging. Unlocking the true ending requires beating several bosses so the replay value is great too.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

There are issues where it wont open if you are not online or are using mobile data. It also crashes sometimes. **story spoilers** It also seems like you should be able to save your grandma if you beat HARD VII, but even when all the memory shards are full for a class, theres no different endings.

I felt there was no storyline and you had to purchase additional content to make the game at least a bit interesting. I prefer buying a game and having it in full to in-app purchases you cannot really have proper control over. In addition, I beat a boss after entering the battle with a fourth of my health, so I think the battle system is not all that either.

A little short and it sucks that ALL the other classes are behind a small paywall. (EDIT Looks like this was patched and you get a few classes. Sweet!) I ended up unlocking all of them, though, and had a lot of fun with each of them. It seems super simple at the beginning, but you can set up some crazy combos. Going back to try hard mode now.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

But not now. I spent the full price to unlock everything and now you got greedy and decided to force ads in the game to paying players. This always happens, why can't developers be happy with their product... This move is just pure greed. Do not support this behaviour, I recommend anyone playing this game not to buy anything until they either remove the ads completely or disable them for paying players.","Rated 2 stars out of five stars","null"

The stories are rather queer, but the voicing really adds atmosphere to the game. As you progress, it's not so challenging that it feels like butting your head against the wall with later runs, too. My only major complaint is that the cards and blessings descriptions REALLY need better wording. These are frequently vague or even WRONG, which obviously sucks (e.g. expected a blessing to proc every turn rather than only in first then turn).","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

Could you make werewolf less overpowered. His deck is too broken and the decision which forces you to heal 90% of his health is pretty broken with the addition of heal 35% Every turn. If possible could you make it a way that we can get the other characters without paying maybe by maxing out the skills of each character you unlock the next. Other than that, game is really good and fun.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

It may seem like a mindless clicker, but I guarantee you've only seen a fraction in what this game offers. From only knowing of special skills when monsters were level 9, it was when I first delved deeper in the game. I then later discovered the many edits, combos and available features which I had never thought of before. Interestingly, this takes an idea of strategy where the user must learn more by themselves in order to defeat enemies.","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

This game had quite a bit of free content, with even more paid content, that, for a mobile game, would be worth it. It started off simple and easy to grasp, and got more challenging the more you played. There was different ways to play, if you wanted to do high amounts of damage, or have lots of health, and even more. There was even achievements, adding a side objective to highten the challenge. Defintely worth paying for the paid content, for a mobile game. I recommend this game.","Rated 4 stars out of five stars","null"

The art is fantastic and the variety of cards is extensive. My only problem is the balancing of some enemies in the game, mostly the Headless Horseman and the Phantom Captain. Those enemies seem like bosses in themselves from their blessings and the amount of damage they do. They need to be nerfed a bit to make playing against them fair.

Restart a new game is kind of the core part of Roguelike game. You will meet different monsters and build a different deck.

I will give you some tips here. 
1. You can save fountain until your HP at a very low value. 
2. Don't pick up every card.

You play as Little Red Riding Hood and can choose from multiple classes, which will determine the theme of the cards that you can obtain. Each playthrough is different, and there are mechanics like the Courage/Reputation system that motivates you to go through the game again to find out what dialogue options provide which (since the mechanic is tied to which boss you can fight at the end). Normal has a nice difficulty for those who are more casual (like myself), and Hard is more suited for those who are interested in figuring out the optimal strategies in terms of deck makeup, which fights to skip, etc. The hand-drawn ""rough"" art style may not be for everyone, and it did bother me a little at first, but it's nothing alarming.

You pretty much mindlessly throw all your cards at the enemy. Their special effects don't matter much and they're super easy. Not much room to customize strategy either. Some reviews seem to say it gets a lot more interesting farther in but I didn't feel like paying to find out, which is a shame because I thought I'd like it.","Rated 2 stars out of five stars","null"

The character design is unique, and opponents typically have their own unique ""decks"" to use against you. I have two concerns though: first is the unlocking of each boss. The witch is automatic; to get the werewolf, you need to have a lot of courage, and the priest requires you to do those two bosses first. Some opponents give you an opportunity to ""interact"" with them, which can ultimately affect which boss you get, but the rewards for the answers are miniscule, I find myself a point shy of getting yhe werewolf because RNG wasn't on my side, and I didn't have the opportunity to gain more reputation/courage. Second, is the characters themselves. Although I praised their design, some of them have ridiculous abilities that make defeating then a lot harder. The Pig Widow and Ghost Dolls are such an example -- I lose a turn, or I can't deal any damage in a turn. It gets annoying after a bit, especially when you're doing it for the EXP or gold, and would rather anything else... It grows tedious fighting them after a while, which is kind of disappointing to me. Criticisms aside, I found it to be a lot of fun, and I'd highly recommend it if you want a game to pass the time with. I spent literal hours playing this without realising, it's different, and fun (although it can be a little tricky in the beginning).","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"

The animations and design elements are excellent, too. After a few run throughs things get repetitive and you easily find the systems that work, so buying the expansions keep the game interesting.

Nice graphics, good sould, and clear controls. There is one serious issue though: the balance. The default difficulty and all intermediate difficulties are super easy! To unlock the final difficulty, you need to repeatedly beat the game 9-10(!) times; and even then, only few last enemies are challenging... Still 5 stars though.

It has quickly become one of my absolute favourites. Such addictive gameplay, beautiful art and animation. Amazing soundtrack. The whole package is polished to perfection! Best of all, there are no ads and purchasing additional classes won't break the bank as they are very reasonably priced. I can't recommend this game enough! Essential!","Rated 5 stars out of five stars","null"
